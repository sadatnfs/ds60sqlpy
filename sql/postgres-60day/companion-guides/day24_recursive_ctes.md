# Day 24 — Recursive CTEs: Hierarchies, Trees, and Graph Walks (Companion Guide)

## Level and prerequisites

- **Level:** Intermediate
- **Prerequisites:** [Day 23 — common table expressions](day23_ctes_intro.md)
- **Artifacts:** [learner SQL](../day24_recursive_ctes.sql) ·
  [solution reasoning](../solutions/day24_solutions.md) ·
  [executable solution](../solutions/day24_solutions.sql)

## Learning objectives

- Build a recursive CTE from compatible anchor and recursive members.
- Track depth and path while preventing cycles.

## Vocabulary and concepts

- **Anchor member:** the non-recursive seed rows.
- **Recursive member:** the query that derives the next rows from prior output.
- **Cycle guard:** a path or visited-key check that prevents revisiting nodes.

## Worked example / walkthrough

Seed each direct manager/report edge with a path array containing both keys.
Each recursive step joins the current report to its direct reports, increments
depth, and rejects a key already present in the path. Inspect the maximum depth
and path before trusting the hierarchy.

## Exercises

Complete the prompts in the [learner SQL](../day24_recursive_ctes.sql). Add a
small cyclic relationship inside the rollback-only transaction and verify the
guard terminates safely.

## Self-check

- Do anchor and recursive branches return the same column types?
- Can you prove recursion terminates for malformed cyclic data?

## Next step

Continue to [Day 25 — multiple CTEs and hierarchies](day25_multiple_ctes_hierarchies.md).

## Deep dive and reference

Learning objectives
- Use WITH RECURSIVE to traverse hierarchical/graph data (up/down)
- Understand anchor vs recursive member, UNION ALL, and termination
- Compute depth, paths, cycle detection, and ordering

Why this matters
Many data structures are hierarchical: org charts, category trees, dependency graphs. Recursive CTEs let you explore them without procedural code.

Core concepts and deep dive
- Anatomy
  - WITH RECURSIVE t AS ( anchor_query UNION ALL recursive_query ) SELECT ... FROM t;
  - Anchor emits starting rows (roots). Recursive member references t and produces next-level rows.
  - Termination occurs when recursive member returns no new rows.
- Columns
  - Ensure both SELECTs output the same column list/types (id, parent_id, depth, path, ...).
- Depth and path
  - depth := anchor depth 0 (or 1) plus 1 each recursion.
  - path := path || id to accumulate ancestry for cycle checks and sorting.
- Cycle detection
  - WHERE id <> ALL(path) prevents revisiting nodes (for graphs with cycles).
- Ordering
  - Use ORDER BY path for pre-order traversal; or track sort_keys.

Patterns
- Downward traversal: employees (`employee_id`, `manager_id`) from a manager to
  all reports.
- Level summaries: GROUP BY depth to count nodes per level.

Pitfalls
- Infinite recursion on cycles; always implement a cycle guard or LIMIT depth.
- UNION vs UNION ALL: use UNION ALL to avoid global de-dup unless necessary; dedup can be expensive.
- Large trees can be costly; index parent_id and id.

Exercises from the learner script
1) For every manager, list all direct and indirect reports with depth.
2) Generate integers 1 through 100 recursively and return their sum.

The first prompt is not a single-root traversal. Seed each direct
manager-report edge, carry the original manager through recursion, and keep a
path array for cycle protection. The setup can have multiple top-level
employees.
