# Day 18 — LAG/LEAD and Intra-Row Comparisons (Companion Guide)

Learning objectives
- Use LAG/LEAD to access prior/next row values within partitions
- Compute deltas, growth rates, and interval gaps
- Handle nulls and defaults with the third LAG/LEAD argument

Why this matters
Many metrics are changes over time: day-over-day growth, time since last purchase, step detection. LAG/LEAD express these cleanly and efficiently.

Core concepts and deep dive
- LAG(expr, offset, default) OVER (PARTITION BY k ORDER BY t): returns value offset rows before current; default substitutes for missing (e.g., first row).
- LEAD symmetric; often used for next timestamp to compute session gaps.
- Differences: expr - LAG(expr) for numeric deltas; AGE(ts, LAG(ts)) for time deltas.

Patterns
- DoD/YoY growth: (x - LAG(x)) / NULLIF(LAG(x),0).
- Sessionization: gap = ts - LAG(ts); new session if gap > interval '30 min'.
- Churn signal: last_order_date per customer and days_since_last.

Pitfalls
- Sorting by a non-unique timestamp yields unpredictable row pairing; add tiebreakers.
- Large partitions without indexes increase sort cost; index on (k, t) helps.

Practice exercises
1) Compute revenue delta and growth rate day-to-day.
2) For each customer, compute days between orders and flag gaps > 60 days.
3) For each product, compute the difference in price from the previous listing.
