# Day 56 Solutions — CUBE and Percentiles


<!-- beginner-solution-enrichment -->
## How to study and run this solution

Open this explanation only after making an honest attempt. The executable
companion runs solely against the disposable `advanced_sql_training` database:

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell, from the repository root
psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d advanced_sql_training -f "sql\postgres-60day\solutions\day56_solutions.sql"
```

```bash
# macOS/Linux, from the repository root
psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d advanced_sql_training \
  -f sql/postgres-60day/solutions/day56_solutions.sql
```

`psql` prints each result/command tag in the terminal. Stop at the first
unexpected `ERROR`; later output cannot repair an earlier failed invariant.
Compare your own SQL, row grain, column names, row counts, `NULL` policy, and
ordering with the explanation before comparing syntax.

## Clause-by-clause reading map

The lesson's main concepts are Dimensional explosion, Primary payment method, Continuous percentile. Its worked-model focus is:
Aggregate payments at (orderid, method), select one method by greatest total with a stable tie-breaker, and only then join line revenue. Separately aggregate line value at (month, category, orderid) before computing p50/p90; whole order totals would repeat across categories.

- Start at `FROM`/`JOIN` and state the intermediate row grain. Inspect join keys
  before adding aggregates; a one-to-many join is allowed to multiply rows only
  when the later contract accounts for it.
- Apply `WHERE` to input rows, `GROUP BY` to form buckets, and `HAVING` to
  completed groups. Window functions run over the surviving relation and
  normally preserve its row count.
- Read the `SELECT` list as the public result contract: keys establish grain,
  measures state calculations, and aliases explain meaning. `ORDER BY` is the
  only output-order guarantee; add a unique tie-breaker before `LIMIT`.
- Trace every common table expression (CTE) as a temporary named relation.
  Execute or inspect one stage at a time while debugging, but compare the final
  result with an independent control rather than trusting stage names.
- Keep SQL `NULL` as “missing/unknown/not applicable” until the metric contract
  chooses another representation. Guard division with `NULLIF`; disclose
  exclusions and distinguish zero from no row.
- For DDL/DML, a command tag proves only that PostgreSQL accepted a statement.
  Catalog checks, negative cases, row-count reconciliation, and the declared
  transaction boundary prove behavior and cleanup.

The exact final queries are not the only valid syntax. A join, subquery, CTE,
window, or conditional aggregate can be an alternative when it preserves the
same grain, `NULL` semantics, deterministic ordering, and safety. Prefer the
form whose intermediate relations a reviewer can verify; optimize only after
correctness is established with evidence.

The exercises add payment method to a multidimensional cube and calculate
category-attributable order-value percentiles by month. See
[`day56_solutions.sql`](day56_solutions.sql).

## Exercise 1 — Add payment method and measure cube growth

An order can have more than one payment. The answer defines its primary method
as the method with the greatest total paid amount, breaking ties by method name.
Reducing to one method prevents order lines from being duplicated; unpaid
orders remain visible.

```sql
SET search_path TO training, public;

WITH payment_by_method AS (
  SELECT order_id, method, SUM(amount) AS paid_amount
  FROM payments
  GROUP BY order_id, method
), ranked_payment AS (
  SELECT *,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
           PARTITION BY order_id ORDER BY paid_amount DESC, method
         ) AS payment_rank
  FROM payment_by_method
), primary_payment AS (
  SELECT order_id, method
  FROM ranked_payment
  WHERE payment_rank = 1
), line AS (
  SELECT c.country,
         p.category,
         COALESCE(pp.method, 'unpaid') AS payment_method,
         oi.unit_price * oi.quantity * (1 - oi.discount) AS revenue
  FROM orders o
  JOIN customers c USING (customer_id)
  JOIN order_items oi USING (order_id)
  JOIN products p USING (product_id)
  LEFT JOIN primary_payment pp USING (order_id)
), cube_two AS (
  SELECT country, category, SUM(revenue) AS revenue
  FROM line
  GROUP BY CUBE (country, category)
), cube_three AS (
  SELECT country, category, payment_method, SUM(revenue) AS revenue
  FROM line
  GROUP BY CUBE (country, category, payment_method)
)
SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cube_two) AS two_dimension_rows,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cube_three) AS three_dimension_rows;
```

Expected shape: one row; `three_dimension_rows` should be larger.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A written prediction plus the actual query/plan output, including the compared row counts, keys, measures, or SQLSTATE named by the prompt.
- **Independent verification:** Run both cases with the same inputs, record the observed difference, and revise the explanation if evidence contradicts the prediction.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 2 — Category-month p50 and p90

The metric is each category's contribution to an order, not the entire order
total repeated for every category.

```sql
SET search_path TO training, public;

WITH category_orders AS (
  SELECT date_trunc('month', o.order_date)::date AS month,
         p.category,
         o.order_id,
         SUM(oi.unit_price * oi.quantity * (1 - oi.discount)) AS order_value
  FROM orders o
  JOIN order_items oi USING (order_id)
  JOIN products p USING (product_id)
  GROUP BY date_trunc('month', o.order_date), p.category, o.order_id
)
SELECT month,
       category,
       ROUND(
         percentile_cont(0.50) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY order_value)::numeric,
         2
       ) AS p50_order_value,
       ROUND(
         percentile_cont(0.90) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY order_value)::numeric,
         2
       ) AS p90_order_value
FROM category_orders
GROUP BY month, category
ORDER BY month DESC, category;
```

Expected grain: one row per represented `(month, category)`.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.
- **Independent verification:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Reasoning, safety, and pitfalls

- Joining all payment rows to lines would multiply revenue for split-payment
  orders. Define a payment attribution policy before adding that dimension.
- Aggregate by `(order_id, method)` before ranking so split payments using the
  same method are compared by their total paid amount.
- The method-name tie-break makes the primary-method policy deterministic.
- `percentile_cont` interpolates and returns a floating type; cast to numeric
  before two-argument `ROUND`.
- Percentiles need enough observations. Always accompany production percentiles
  with sample counts.

## Exercise 3 — Measure raw fanout

The raw payment/item join reports joined rows and distinct source keys. Orders
with several rows on both sides demonstrate the multiplication risk.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A written prediction plus the actual query/plan output, including the compared row counts, keys, measures, or SQLSTATE named by the prompt.
- **Independent verification:** Run both cases with the same inputs, record the observed difference, and revise the explanation if evidence contradicts the prediction.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 4 — Attribute at order grain

Payment policy reduces methods to one order-level label; line revenue also
reduces to one order row. The windowed grand total reconciles attribution.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.
- **Independent verification:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 5 — Match percentile grain

`category_order` emits one observation per category/order before calculating
P50. A line-item percentile would answer a different question.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** Evidence of the incorrect behavior followed by a corrected result at the declared grain, with the violated invariant made visible.
- **Independent verification:** Keep a minimal failing case, rerun the corrected form, and compare keys/counts/totals so the repair is proved rather than asserted.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 6 — Compare percentile definitions

Continuous P50 can interpolate; discrete P50 is an observed order value. The
observation count is retained so even-sized groups can be interpreted.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A written prediction plus the actual query/plan output, including the compared row counts, keys, measures, or SQLSTATE named by the prompt.
- **Independent verification:** Run both cases with the same inputs, record the observed difference, and revise the explanation if evidence contradicts the prediction.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.
