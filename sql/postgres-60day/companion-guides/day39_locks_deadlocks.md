# Day 39 — Locks, Blocking, and Deadlocks

## Level and prerequisites

- **Level:** Advanced
- **Prerequisites:** [Day 38 — transactions and isolation](day38_transactions_isolation.md)
- **Artifacts:** [learner SQL](../day39_locks_deadlocks.sql) ·
  [solution reasoning](../solutions/day39_solutions.md) ·
  [executable solution](../solutions/day39_solutions.sql)

## Learning objectives

- Observe blocking and deadlock state without intervening blindly.
- Prevent a lock cycle with consistent acquisition order and design queue
  claiming with `SKIP LOCKED`.

## Vocabulary and concepts

- **Blocking:** one session waiting for an incompatible lock held elsewhere.
- **Deadlock:** a cycle of sessions each waiting for another in the cycle.
- **Advisory lock:** an application-defined coordination lock not tied to a row.

## Worked example / walkthrough

In two disposable sessions, lock test rows 1 and 2 in opposite orders and
inspect the wait before PostgreSQL aborts one participant with `40P01`. Roll
back, then repeat with both sessions ordering keys ascending to show the cycle
cannot form.

## Exercises

Complete these in the [learner SQL](../day39_locks_deadlocks.sql):

1. Reproduce a deadlock and inspect it with `pg_locks`.
2. Prevent it with consistent key ordering.
3. Demonstrate a `SKIP LOCKED` worker.
4. Predict `NOWAIT` behavior when another session owns the lock.
5. Atomically claim/update at most five queue rows.
6. Preserve deterministic key ordering through the locking SELECT.
7. Test a transaction-level advisory lock.

Use a disposable queue and prove two workers claim different rows.

## Self-check

- Can you identify blocker, waiter, resource, and statement from evidence?
- Is `SKIP LOCKED` limited to queue-like work where an inconsistent view is
  acceptable?

## Next step

Continue to [Day 40 — advanced analytic functions](day40_analytic_functions_advanced.md).

## Deep dive and reference

## What you will learn

- Inspect locks with `pg_locks` and session state with `pg_stat_activity`.
- Reproduce a deadlock safely and prevent it with consistent lock order.
- Use `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` for competing queue workers.

## How the learner script uses the current schema

The script lists current locks, selects five high-value `orders` in ascending
`order_id`, and locks those same rows in a consistent order. It also introduces
transaction- and session-level advisory locks as application coordination
tools.

A deadlock is a cycle: session A waits for B while B waits for A. PostgreSQL
detects the cycle and aborts one transaction with SQLSTATE `40P01`. Consistent
key order, small transactions, and avoiding user pauses inside transactions
reduce risk.

## Practice — match the learner prompts exactly

1. In two disposable sessions, lock two test rows in opposite order, capture the
   waits in `pg_locks`, then let PostgreSQL detect the deadlock.
2. Repeat with both sessions acquiring rows in ascending key order.
3. Use a disposable job table and `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` so two
   workers claim different unprocessed rows.

## Operational safety

- Do not run the deliberate deadlock against production or important shared
  orders.
- `SKIP LOCKED` is appropriate for queue-like work; it gives an inconsistent
  view and is not a general reporting option.
- `NOWAIT` fails immediately, while `lock_timeout` allows a bounded wait.
- Investigate ownership and impact before canceling or terminating any backend.

## Validation

Record the two-session statement sequence, the blocked/aborted session, SQLSTATE,
and proof that the consistent-order version completes. Roll back or drop all
disposable queue/deadlock objects.

## Expanded practice lab

Prompts 4–7 compare waiting, immediate failure, cooperative queues, and advisory
coordination. `NOWAIT` raises an error instead of waiting; `SKIP LOCKED` omits
currently claimed rows, which is useful for workers but wrong for complete
reporting.

Claim and update queue rows in one transaction, with a deterministic key order.
Use `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock` for a non-blocking application lock that releases
automatically at transaction end. Advisory locks work only when every actor
follows the same key convention.
