# cuda-044: Second capstone: a streaming numerical service core

## Level and prerequisites

Intermediate; about 110 minutes, plus any optional hardware experiment. Direct prerequisites: `cuda-038`, `cuda-039`, `cuda-040`, `cuda-041`, `cuda-042`, `cuda-043`

The order supports learning at your own pace. Reading and CPU reasoning remain
available when NVIDIA hardware is absent. Advanced hardware features need their
own capability checks and are not prerequisites for opening this chapter.

## Learning objectives

Explain second capstone: a streaming numerical service core using the concrete cases below. Produce all outputs match, no chunk is dropped or reused early, memory stays within the budget, and the report separates request latency from throughput.
Distinguish an algorithmic calculation, a compiled artifact and an actual device
observation when explaining what your work establishes.

## Purpose, vocabulary and mental model

A streaming compute service needs bounded ownership and backpressure before it needs more streams. Backpressure means producers stop or reject work when the system cannot safely accept another item. A slot moves through states such as free, filling, computing, copying and consumed. Reuse is allowed only after the final consumer completes. Cancellation stops admission and cleans up according to actual completion state; it does not magically cancel every submitted device instruction. This capstone is a bounded local pipeline, not a new network server inside the classroom worker.

## How to run and study this lesson

Open this chapter in `/classroom` and use its saved reading worksheet. The primary
reading pad does not execute CUDA. The two examples, six tasks and separate
explanations are usable offline on macOS, Linux and Windows through WSL 2 with
the ordinary classroom. An AMD, Intel or Apple GPU does not make this CUDA C++
source executable through Docker.

For the bounded CPU calculation, select **CPU model (Python)** in this lesson.
That variant keeps its own source and result history under the same chapter. Its
answer-free starter supplies literal fixtures and the task contract; implement
the model and assertions before replacing its deliberate incomplete-work error.
The separate [CPU reference](../references/cuda-044_cpu.py) uses only Python's
standard library. For an optional terminal workflow, run this from the repository
root in a prepared Python environment:

```sh
python courses/cuda/cpp/references/cuda-044_cpu.py
```

The assertions check the stated numerical result or model invariant. Console text
is evidence of this CPU reference only. The [CUDA C++ study workflow](../README.md)
explains optional GPU compilation, paths, hardware requirements and evidence labels.
No lesson opening downloads a model, installs a driver or starts a GPU job.

## Worked example 1: trace the mechanism

With capacity two, submit chunks A and B. Chunk C waits until a slot becomes free. If A finishes compute but its output is still downloading, A's slot is not yet free. A correct queue can process arbitrary many chunks with constant bounded storage by reusing only completed slots.

The complete CPU model below intentionally models only the named arithmetic,
layout, dependency or capability decision. It does not model GPU scheduling,
caches, instruction timing or device memory visibility.

```python
states = ["free", "filling", "computing", "copying", "consumed", "free"]
assert states.index("computing") < states.index("consumed")
chunks = [[1, 2], [3], [], [4, 5]]
results = [[2 * x for x in chunk] for chunk in chunks]
assert results == [[2, 4], [6], [], [8, 10]]
print({"reference_results": results, "slot_lifecycle": states})
```

**Expected observation:** Every assertion succeeds. A representative CPU output is:

```text
{'reference_results': [[2, 4], [6], [], [8, 10]], 'slot_lifecycle': ['free', 'filling', 'computing', 'copying', 'consumed', 'free']}
```

Tiny floating-point display differences across platforms are acceptable only
where the explicit assertions use a tolerance; integers, shapes and ordering
must still satisfy their exact contracts. A printed hypothetical duration is a
model output, not a measured GPU benchmark.

## Worked example 2: change a meaningful condition

A synchronous pipeline has 7 ms latency per chunk. A pipelined version can deliver later chunks every 3 ms while the first still takes roughly 7 ms in the ideal model. Throughput and first-result latency are distinct objectives; reporting only the inter-result interval hides the user's wait.

Before applying this example to your own program, write down which inputs are
read, which result is produced, and the condition that makes the comparison
valid. Keep the original case as a regression check when changing a boundary.

## Six progressive exercises

### Exercise 1

Predict and trace the first worked example before running its CPU reference. Write every intermediate quantity that leads to the stated result, including units or ownership where applicable.

**Self-check:** Retain the requested calculation, output, diagram or explicit failure policy so another reader can compare it with the worked cases.

**Hint 1:** Start with the literal input and intermediate quantities in worked example 1.

**Hint 2:** Review the mechanism paragraph and the relevant bounded CPU assertion; separate mathematical reasoning from optional device evidence.

### Exercise 2

Reconstruct the second worked example without copying its conclusion. Identify the changed input or condition, show the resulting calculation or dependency, and explain why it differs from the first example.

**Self-check:** Retain the requested calculation, output, diagram or explicit failure policy so another reader can compare it with the worked cases.

**Hint 1:** Identify exactly which condition changes in worked example 2.

**Hint 2:** Review the mechanism paragraph and the relevant bounded CPU assertion; separate mathematical reasoning from optional device evidence.

### Exercise 3

Write legal transitions for a two-slot pipeline.

**Self-check:** Retain the requested calculation, output, diagram or explicit failure policy so another reader can compare it with the worked cases.

**Hint 1:** Use the first worked example to establish the relevant quantities, then change only the requested input.

**Hint 2:** Review the mechanism paragraph and the relevant bounded CPU assertion; separate mathematical reasoning from optional device evidence.

### Exercise 4

A cancellation handler immediately frees all device buffers. What is missing?

**Self-check:** Retain the requested calculation, output, diagram or explicit failure policy so another reader can compare it with the worked cases.

**Hint 1:** Locate the failed phase or violated dependency before proposing a repair.

**Hint 2:** Review the mechanism paragraph and the relevant bounded CPU assertion; separate mathematical reasoning from optional device evidence.

### Exercise 5

What should happen to a zero-length chunk?

**Self-check:** Retain the requested calculation, output, diagram or explicit failure policy so another reader can compare it with the worked cases.

**Hint 1:** Check what the algorithm is allowed to read, write or assume at this boundary.

**Hint 2:** Review the mechanism paragraph and the relevant bounded CPU assertion; separate mathematical reasoning from optional device evidence.

### Exercise 6

Define capstone acceptance beyond timing.

**Self-check:** Retain the requested calculation, output, diagram or explicit failure policy so another reader can compare it with the worked cases.

**Hint 1:** State the output contract and which observations are needed in the new application.

**Hint 2:** Review the mechanism paragraph and the relevant bounded CPU assertion; separate mathematical reasoning from optional device evidence.

## Common mistakes and diagnosis

A tempting but incorrect claim in this chapter is: **maximizing batch size automatically gives the best user experience.**

For the concrete failure exercise, a cancellation handler immediately frees all device buffers. What is missing?
Preserve the original input and the stage where behavior diverged. Compare with
the CPU model or dependency diagram before changing hardware configuration.
A compiler result, synthetic timing model, profiler counter and returned numeric
answer support different claims. Record unavailable hardware honestly.

## Self-check, retrieval and transfer

Explain the first example without its code, then use the second example to state
one assumption that matters. Complete Exercise 3 independently, use Exercise 4 to
diagnose a plausible defect, check the boundary in Exercise 5, and retain the
application contract from Exercise 6. Compare the [separate explanations](../solutions/cuda-044_solutions.md)
only after your attempt or a deliberate reveal. A reading marker records your
choice; it does not certify hardware qualification or expert mastery.
