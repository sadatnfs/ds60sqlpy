# Day 43 Solutions — Logical Backup and Recovery


<!-- beginner-solution-enrichment -->
## How to study and run this solution

Open this explanation only after making an honest attempt. The executable
companion runs solely against the disposable `advanced_sql_training` database:

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell, from the repository root
psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d advanced_sql_training -f "sql\postgres-60day\solutions\day43_solutions.sql"
```

```bash
# macOS/Linux, from the repository root
psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d advanced_sql_training \
  -f sql/postgres-60day/solutions/day43_solutions.sql
```

`psql` prints each result/command tag in the terminal. Stop at the first
unexpected `ERROR`; later output cannot repair an earlier failed invariant.
Compare your own SQL, row grain, column names, row counts, `NULL` policy, and
ordering with the explanation before comparing syntax.

## Clause-by-clause reading map

The lesson's main concepts are Logical backup, Staging table, Idempotent merge. Its worked-model focus is:
Use \copy (SELECT ... WHERE ...) TO ... from a path owned by the learner, import into a staging table, and compare count, keys, types, and sample rows. Only then merge inside BEGIN/ROLLBACK with an explicit email conflict policy.

- Start at `FROM`/`JOIN` and state the intermediate row grain. Inspect join keys
  before adding aggregates; a one-to-many join is allowed to multiply rows only
  when the later contract accounts for it.
- Apply `WHERE` to input rows, `GROUP BY` to form buckets, and `HAVING` to
  completed groups. Window functions run over the surviving relation and
  normally preserve its row count.
- Read the `SELECT` list as the public result contract: keys establish grain,
  measures state calculations, and aliases explain meaning. `ORDER BY` is the
  only output-order guarantee; add a unique tie-breaker before `LIMIT`.
- Trace every common table expression (CTE) as a temporary named relation.
  Execute or inspect one stage at a time while debugging, but compare the final
  result with an independent control rather than trusting stage names.
- Keep SQL `NULL` as “missing/unknown/not applicable” until the metric contract
  chooses another representation. Guard division with `NULLIF`; disclose
  exclusions and distinguish zero from no row.
- For DDL/DML, a command tag proves only that PostgreSQL accepted a statement.
  Catalog checks, negative cases, row-count reconciliation, and the declared
  transaction boundary prove behavior and cleanup.

The exact final queries are not the only valid syntax. A join, subquery, CTE,
window, or conditional aggregate can be an alternative when it preserves the
same grain, `NULL` semantics, deterministic ordering, and safety. Prefer the
form whose intermediate relations a reviewer can verify; optimize only after
correctness is established with evidence.

This day distinguishes client-side export from database recovery logic. The
answer uses `COPY ... TO STDOUT` so it works through the current connection and
models a restore with a temporary staging table. See
[`day43_solutions.sql`](day43_solutions.sql).

## Exercise 1 — Export and stage a subset

In interactive `psql`, `\copy` writes on the client machine:

```text
\copy (SELECT * FROM training.customers WHERE country = 'US' ORDER BY customer_id) TO 'customers_us.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true)
```

Replace that filename with a path the learner owns. Path syntax, directory
creation, and write permission are environment-specific on Windows, macOS, and
Linux; the repository cannot choose or create that destination safely.

The executable solution uses SQL-standard server output instead:

```sql
BEGIN;
SET search_path TO training, public;

COPY (
  SELECT customer_id, full_name, email, country, created_at, segment, attributes
  FROM customers
  WHERE country = 'US'
  ORDER BY customer_id
) TO STDOUT WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true);

CREATE TEMP TABLE customers_restore_stage AS
SELECT full_name, email, country, created_at, segment, attributes
FROM customers
WHERE country = 'US';

SELECT COUNT(*) AS staged_rows FROM customers_restore_stage;
ROLLBACK;
```

Expected shape: CSV rows are streamed to the client, and `staged_rows` equals
the number of US customers. A real import would create an explicit staging
table and run `\copy customers_restore_stage FROM ...`.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.
- **Independent verification:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 2 — Idempotent restore with conflict handling

Email is the current schema's unique business key for this exercise.

```sql
BEGIN;
SET search_path TO training, public;

CREATE TEMP TABLE customers_restore_stage AS
SELECT full_name, email, country, created_at, segment, attributes
FROM customers
WHERE country = 'US';

UPDATE customers_restore_stage
SET full_name = full_name || ' [restored]'
WHERE email = 'customer1@example.com';

INSERT INTO customers(full_name, email, country, created_at, segment, attributes)
SELECT full_name, email, country, created_at, segment, attributes
FROM customers_restore_stage
ON CONFLICT (email) DO UPDATE
SET full_name = EXCLUDED.full_name,
    country = EXCLUDED.country,
    segment = EXCLUDED.segment,
    attributes = EXCLUDED.attributes;

ROLLBACK;
```

The transaction proves both insert and update paths while leaving the course
data unchanged.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.
- **Independent verification:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Reasoning, safety, and pitfalls

- `COPY ... TO '/path'` reads or writes on the database server and usually needs
  elevated privileges. `\copy` reads or writes on the `psql` client.
- Restore into staging first; validate counts, keys, types, and representative
  rows before merging into the base table.
- `ON CONFLICT` is idempotent only when the conflict key represents the intended
  entity and update policy.
- Logical export is not point-in-time recovery. Production PITR requires base
  backups plus WAL archiving, which is outside this SQL-only exercise.

## Exercise 3 — Choose COPY or backslash-copy

Server-side `COPY` accesses the database server's filesystem. psql `\copy`
streams through the client, which is usually the appropriate learner-machine
workflow.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A written prediction plus the actual query/plan output, including the compared row counts, keys, measures, or SQLSTATE named by the prompt.
- **Independent verification:** Run both cases with the same inputs, record the observed difference, and revise the explanation if evidence contradicts the prediction.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 4 — Build a manifest

The manifest records table, count, key range, and observation time. Production
automation should also hash the exported file outside SQL.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** The statement completes with the expected command tag, and a catalog or behavior query exposes the named object/rule; no unrelated schema object persists.
- **Independent verification:** Inspect the applicable pgcatalog/informationschema entry and run one valid plus one boundary case inside the lesson's safety boundary.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 5 — Deduplicate deterministically

`ROW_NUMBER` partitions by normalized email and orders by an explicit newest/
tie-break policy. Upsert never receives arbitrary duplicate winners.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.
- **Independent verification:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 6 — Compare NULL safely

`IS DISTINCT FROM` treats two NULLs as equal and one NULL as different. It
therefore reports real source/restore differences without UNKNOWN results.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A written prediction plus the actual query/plan output, including the compared row counts, keys, measures, or SQLSTATE named by the prompt.
- **Independent verification:** Run both cases with the same inputs, record the observed difference, and revise the explanation if evidence contradicts the prediction.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.
