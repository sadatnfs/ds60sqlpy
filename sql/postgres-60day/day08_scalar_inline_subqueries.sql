-- Scalar subquery in SELECT: customer lifetime revenue
SELECT c.customer_id, c.full_name,
  (
    SELECT ROUND(COALESCE(SUM(oi.unit_price * oi.quantity * (1 - oi.discount)),0),2)

    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
  ) AS lifetime_revenue

ORDER BY lifetime_revenue DESC

-- Inline subquery in FROM
SELECT x.category, ROUND(AVG(x.order_total),2) AS avg_order_total
FROM (
  SELECT p.category, o.order_id, SUM(oi.unit_price*oi.quantity*(1-oi.discount)) AS order_total

-- 2) For each customer, show their first order date via subquery.
