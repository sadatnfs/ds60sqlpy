# cuda-033: Nsight Compute: interpret kernel counters carefully

## Level and prerequisites

Intermediate; about 110 minutes, plus any optional hardware experiment. Direct prerequisites: `cuda-002`, `cuda-007`, `cuda-031`

The order supports learning at your own pace. Reading and CPU reasoning remain
available when NVIDIA hardware is absent. Advanced hardware features need their
own capability checks and are not prerequisites for opening this chapter.

## Learning objectives

Explain nsight Compute: interpret kernel counters carefully using the concrete cases below. Produce two supported claims and one explicitly unresolved hypothesis.
Distinguish an algorithmic calculation, a compiled artifact and an actual device
observation when explaining what your work establishes.

## Purpose, vocabulary and mental model

Kernel counters describe selected aspects of execution, often through replay or sampled collection. They require context: achieved occupancy is a residency measurement, memory throughput measures traffic, and eligible-warps metrics describe scheduling opportunity. High utilization can mean an inefficient algorithm is busy moving unnecessary data. Low utilization can be expected for tiny work. Counter permissions are separate from ordinary CUDA execution capability; a working kernel does not promise profiler access. Start with a small question and a few relevant metrics, keeping the baseline's input, dtype and result contract fixed.

## How to run and study this lesson

Open this chapter in `/classroom` and use its saved reading worksheet. The primary
reading pad does not execute CUDA. The two examples, six tasks and separate
explanations are usable offline on macOS, Linux and Windows through WSL 2 with
the ordinary classroom. An AMD, Intel or Apple GPU does not make this CUDA C++
source executable through Docker.

For the bounded CPU calculation, select **CPU model (Python)** in this lesson.
That variant keeps its own source and result history under the same chapter. Its
answer-free starter supplies literal fixtures and the task contract; implement
the model and assertions before replacing its deliberate incomplete-work error.
The separate [CPU reference](../references/cuda-033_cpu.py) uses only Python's
standard library. For an optional terminal workflow, run this from the repository
root in a prepared Python environment:

```sh
python courses/cuda/cpp/references/cuda-033_cpu.py
```

The assertions check the stated numerical result or model invariant. Console text
is evidence of this CPU reference only. The [CUDA C++ study workflow](../README.md)
explains optional GPU compilation, paths, hardware requirements and evidence labels.
No lesson opening downloads a model, installs a driver or starts a GPU job.

## Worked example 1: trace the mechanism

A synthetic kernel reads 400 useful bytes but causes 1,600 transferred bytes because of its access pattern. Useful-to-transferred ratio is 0.25. A high DRAM traffic counter does not imply useful data processing is efficient. Compare address patterns and a corrected layout before blaming arithmetic capacity.

The complete CPU model below intentionally models only the named arithmetic,
layout, dependency or capability decision. It does not model GPU scheduling,
caches, instruction timing or device memory visibility.

```python
useful, transferred = 400, 1600
assert useful / transferred == 0.25
assert 12_000_000 / 0.0002 == 60_000_000_000
print({"useful_fraction": useful / transferred, "useful_GB_per_second": 60})
```

**Expected observation:** Every assertion succeeds. A representative CPU output is:

```text
{'useful_fraction': 0.25, 'useful_GB_per_second': 60}
```

Tiny floating-point display differences across platforms are acceptable only
where the explicit assertions use a tolerance; integers, shapes and ordering
must still satisfy their exact contracts. A printed hypothetical duration is a
model output, not a measured GPU benchmark.

## Worked example 2: change a meaningful condition

Two kernels show 50% and 75% occupancy, yet times are 2 and 3 ms. Occupancy alone cannot rank them. The second may do more instructions, spill registers or repeat loads. Keep both correctness and selected counters with the timings, and state which causal explanation remains a hypothesis.

Before applying this example to your own program, write down which inputs are
read, which result is produced, and the condition that makes the comparison
valid. Keep the original case as a regression check when changing a boundary.

## Six progressive exercises

### Exercise 1

Predict and trace the first worked example before running its CPU reference. Write every intermediate quantity that leads to the stated result, including units or ownership where applicable.

**Self-check:** Retain the requested calculation, output, diagram or explicit failure policy so another reader can compare it with the worked cases.

**Hint 1:** Start with the literal input and intermediate quantities in worked example 1.

**Hint 2:** Review the mechanism paragraph and the relevant bounded CPU assertion; separate mathematical reasoning from optional device evidence.

### Exercise 2

Reconstruct the second worked example without copying its conclusion. Identify the changed input or condition, show the resulting calculation or dependency, and explain why it differs from the first example.

**Self-check:** Retain the requested calculation, output, diagram or explicit failure policy so another reader can compare it with the worked cases.

**Hint 1:** Identify exactly which condition changes in worked example 2.

**Hint 2:** Review the mechanism paragraph and the relevant bounded CPU assertion; separate mathematical reasoning from optional device evidence.

### Exercise 3

Calculate useful throughput for 12 MB processed in 0.2 ms.

**Self-check:** Retain the requested calculation, output, diagram or explicit failure policy so another reader can compare it with the worked cases.

**Hint 1:** Use the first worked example to establish the relevant quantities, then change only the requested input.

**Hint 2:** Review the mechanism paragraph and the relevant bounded CPU assertion; separate mathematical reasoning from optional device evidence.

### Exercise 4

Why can a profiler run differ from an ordinary timing run?

**Self-check:** Retain the requested calculation, output, diagram or explicit failure policy so another reader can compare it with the worked cases.

**Hint 1:** Locate the failed phase or violated dependency before proposing a repair.

**Hint 2:** Review the mechanism paragraph and the relevant bounded CPU assertion; separate mathematical reasoning from optional device evidence.

### Exercise 5

What if hardware counters are unavailable?

**Self-check:** Retain the requested calculation, output, diagram or explicit failure policy so another reader can compare it with the worked cases.

**Hint 1:** Check what the algorithm is allowed to read, write or assume at this boundary.

**Hint 2:** Review the mechanism paragraph and the relevant bounded CPU assertion; separate mathematical reasoning from optional device evidence.

### Exercise 6

Design a counter-based investigation for strided reads.

**Self-check:** Retain the requested calculation, output, diagram or explicit failure policy so another reader can compare it with the worked cases.

**Hint 1:** State the output contract and which observations are needed in the new application.

**Hint 2:** Review the mechanism paragraph and the relevant bounded CPU assertion; separate mathematical reasoning from optional device evidence.

## Common mistakes and diagnosis

A tempting but incorrect claim in this chapter is: **a high utilization percentage proves the algorithm is efficient or any single metric diagnoses all bottlenecks. .**

For the concrete failure exercise, why can a profiler run differ from an ordinary timing run?
Preserve the original input and the stage where behavior diverged. Compare with
the CPU model or dependency diagram before changing hardware configuration.
A compiler result, synthetic timing model, profiler counter and returned numeric
answer support different claims. Record unavailable hardware honestly.

## Self-check, retrieval and transfer

Explain the first example without its code, then use the second example to state
one assumption that matters. Complete Exercise 3 independently, use Exercise 4 to
diagnose a plausible defect, check the boundary in Exercise 5, and retain the
application contract from Exercise 6. Compare the [separate explanations](../solutions/cuda-033_solutions.md)
only after your attempt or a deliberate reveal. A reading marker records your
choice; it does not certify hardware qualification or expert mastery.

toolkit before optional hardware execution.
