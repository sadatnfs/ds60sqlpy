# Day 34 — Solutions: Query Optimization Techniques


<!-- beginner-solution-enrichment -->
## How to study and run this solution

Open this explanation only after making an honest attempt. The executable
companion runs solely against the disposable `advanced_sql_training` database:

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell, from the repository root
psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d advanced_sql_training -f "sql\postgres-60day\solutions\day34_solutions.sql"
```

```bash
# macOS/Linux, from the repository root
psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d advanced_sql_training \
  -f sql/postgres-60day/solutions/day34_solutions.sql
```

`psql` prints each result/command tag in the terminal. Stop at the first
unexpected `ERROR`; later output cannot repair an earlier failed invariant.
Compare your own SQL, row grain, column names, row counts, `NULL` policy, and
ordering with the explanation before comparing syntax.

## Clause-by-clause reading map

The lesson's main concepts are Baseline, Predicate pushdown, Semantic equivalence. Its worked-model focus is:
Capture a baseline and control totals, replace a repeated scalar aggregate with one grouped relation, and join it back. Recheck keys and totals before comparing plans; a faster query that silently drops zero-order customers is not an optimization of the same requirement.

- Start at `FROM`/`JOIN` and state the intermediate row grain. Inspect join keys
  before adding aggregates; a one-to-many join is allowed to multiply rows only
  when the later contract accounts for it.
- Apply `WHERE` to input rows, `GROUP BY` to form buckets, and `HAVING` to
  completed groups. Window functions run over the surviving relation and
  normally preserve its row count.
- Read the `SELECT` list as the public result contract: keys establish grain,
  measures state calculations, and aliases explain meaning. `ORDER BY` is the
  only output-order guarantee; add a unique tie-breaker before `LIMIT`.
- Trace every common table expression (CTE) as a temporary named relation.
  Execute or inspect one stage at a time while debugging, but compare the final
  result with an independent control rather than trusting stage names.
- Keep SQL `NULL` as “missing/unknown/not applicable” until the metric contract
  chooses another representation. Guard division with `NULLIF`; disclose
  exclusions and distinguish zero from no row.
- For DDL/DML, a command tag proves only that PostgreSQL accepted a statement.
  Catalog checks, negative cases, row-count reconciliation, and the declared
  transaction boundary prove behavior and cleanup.

The exact final queries are not the only valid syntax. A join, subquery, CTE,
window, or conditional aggregate can be an alternative when it preserves the
same grain, `NULL` semantics, deterministic ordering, and safety. Prefer the
form whose intermediate relations a reviewer can verify; optimize only after
correctness is established with evidence.

Optimization must preserve meaning. Compare plans only after confirming that
the original and rewritten queries return the same rows at the same grain.

## Exercise 1 — Replace a subquery with a join

The first query uses `EXISTS`; the second uses joins. `DISTINCT` is necessary in
the join form because one order can contain multiple Electronics lines.

```sql
SET search_path TO training, public;

EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
SELECT o.order_id,
       o.order_date
FROM orders o
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM order_items oi
  JOIN products p ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
  WHERE oi.order_id = o.order_id
    AND p.category = 'Electronics'
);

EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
SELECT DISTINCT o.order_id,
       o.order_date
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
JOIN products p ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
WHERE p.category = 'Electronics';
```

PostgreSQL may already transform `EXISTS` into a semi-join, so the explicit join
is not automatically faster. Compare final row counts as well as cost and time.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A written prediction plus the actual query/plan output, including the compared row counts, keys, measures, or SQLSTATE named by the prompt.
- **Independent verification:** Run both cases with the same inputs, record the observed difference, and revise the explanation if evidence contradicts the prediction.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** Pre-aggregation or a differently ordered join pipeline is valid only if it prevents fanout and reconciles to the same scoped control total.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 2 — Limit rows before enrichment

Both forms request the latest 100 orders with customer country. The second form
makes the bounded order set explicit before the dimension join.

```sql
SET search_path TO training, public;

EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
SELECT o.order_id,
       o.order_date,
       c.country
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
ORDER BY o.order_date DESC, o.order_id DESC
LIMIT 100;

EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
WITH top_orders AS MATERIALIZED (
  SELECT order_id,
         customer_id,
         order_date
  FROM orders
  ORDER BY order_date DESC, order_id DESC
  LIMIT 100
)
SELECT t.order_id,
       t.order_date,
       c.country
FROM top_orders t
JOIN customers c ON c.customer_id = t.customer_id
ORDER BY t.order_date DESC, t.order_id DESC;
```

Expected shape for either actual query: 100 rows when at least 100 orders exist.
`MATERIALIZED` is used here to make the learning contrast visible; in ordinary
code, allow PostgreSQL to inline a CTE unless an optimization fence is needed.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.
- **Independent verification:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Pitfalls

- A join can multiply rows. Never remove `EXISTS` without checking the
  relationship cardinality.
- “Filter early” is not a rule to duplicate everywhere; PostgreSQL can push
  many predicates itself.
- An early `LIMIT` is valid only when it selects the same ordered set the final
  query requires.
- Faster on one tiny seeded database is not sufficient evidence for a
  production rewrite.

## Exercise 3 — Compare CTE planner boundaries

`MATERIALIZED` computes/stores the CTE as a boundary. `NOT MATERIALIZED` permits
folding into the parent query. Compare plans; neither spelling is universally
faster.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A written prediction plus the actual query/plan output, including the compared row counts, keys, measures, or SQLSTATE named by the prompt.
- **Independent verification:** Run both cases with the same inputs, record the observed difference, and revise the explanation if evidence contradicts the prediction.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 4 — Pre-aggregate to order grain

`item_totals` emits one row per order before customer/country joins. This
reduces fanout while preserving the unit total.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.
- **Independent verification:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** Pre-aggregation or a differently ordered join pipeline is valid only if it prevents fanout and reconciles to the same scoped control total.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 5 — Repair two-many-side fanout

Payments and items are independently many-to-one with orders. Each is grouped
by `order_id` before their results are joined, so amounts are never multiplied.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** Evidence of the incorrect behavior followed by a corrected result at the declared grain, with the violated invariant made visible.
- **Independent verification:** Keep a minimal failing case, rerun the corrected form, and compare keys/counts/totals so the repair is proved rather than asserted.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 6 — Write a NULL-safe anti-join

`NOT EXISTS` asks whether a matching order exists for the current customer.
Unlike nullable `NOT IN`, one NULL produced by the inner relation cannot turn
every comparison into UNKNOWN.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.
- **Independent verification:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** Pre-aggregation or a differently ordered join pipeline is valid only if it prevents fanout and reconciles to the same scoped control total.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.
