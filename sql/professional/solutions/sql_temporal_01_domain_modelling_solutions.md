# SQL-TEMPORAL-01 Solutions — Temporal and Domain Modelling


<!-- beginner-solution-enrichment -->
## How to study and run this solution

Open this explanation only after making an honest attempt. The executable
companion runs solely against the disposable `advanced_sql_training` database:

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell, from the repository root
psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d advanced_sql_training -f "sql\professional\solutions\sql_temporal_01_domain_modelling_solutions.sql"
```

```bash
# macOS/Linux, from the repository root
psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d advanced_sql_training \
  -f sql/professional/solutions/sql_temporal_01_domain_modelling_solutions.sql
```

`psql` prints each result/command tag in the terminal. Stop at the first
unexpected `ERROR`; later output cannot repair an earlier failed invariant.
Compare your own SQL, row grain, column names, row counts, `NULL` policy, and
ordering with the explanation before comparing syntax.

## Clause-by-clause reading map

The lesson's main concepts are Valid time, System time, Bitemporal, As-of query, Half-open interval, Exclusion constraint. Its worked-model focus is:
The term-version grain is one recorded version of one customer's fact. A February-valid rate first enters the system March 1. On March 10, the old system period is closed and a corrected row begins. Querying valid February 15 as known March 5 returns 10; as known March 15 returns 12. History is appended/closed, not overwritten.

- Start at `FROM`/`JOIN` and state the intermediate row grain. Inspect join keys
  before adding aggregates; a one-to-many join is allowed to multiply rows only
  when the later contract accounts for it.
- Apply `WHERE` to input rows, `GROUP BY` to form buckets, and `HAVING` to
  completed groups. Window functions run over the surviving relation and
  normally preserve its row count.
- Read the `SELECT` list as the public result contract: keys establish grain,
  measures state calculations, and aliases explain meaning. `ORDER BY` is the
  only output-order guarantee; add a unique tie-breaker before `LIMIT`.
- Trace every common table expression (CTE) as a temporary named relation.
  Execute or inspect one stage at a time while debugging, but compare the final
  result with an independent control rather than trusting stage names.
- Keep SQL `NULL` as “missing/unknown/not applicable” until the metric contract
  chooses another representation. Guard division with `NULLIF`; disclose
  exclusions and distinguish zero from no row.
- For DDL/DML, a command tag proves only that PostgreSQL accepted a statement.
  Catalog checks, negative cases, row-count reconciliation, and the declared
  transaction boundary prove behavior and cleanup.

The exact final queries are not the only valid syntax. A join, subquery, CTE,
window, or conditional aggregate can be an alternative when it preserves the
same grain, `NULL` semantics, deterministic ordering, and safety. Prefer the
form whose intermediate relations a reviewer can verify; optimize only after
correctness is established with evidence.

Run:

```text
psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d advanced_sql_training -f sql/professional/solutions/sql_temporal_01_domain_modelling_solutions.sql
```

The solution is fixed-time and rolls back.

## Exercise 1 — Retroactive correction

Close the prior system period at April 1 and append a new version whose valid
period still begins January 1. Valid February 15 as known March 15 returns the
March version; the same valid date as known April 2 returns the April correction.
This answers “what did we know then?” without rewriting knowledge history.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A written prediction plus the actual query/plan output, including the compared row counts, keys, measures, or SQLSTATE named by the prompt.
- **Independent verification:** Run both cases with the same inputs, record the observed difference, and revise the explanation if evidence contradicts the prediction.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 2 — Boundaries

Test `lower`, just before upper, and exactly upper for both date and timestamp
ranges. `[lower,upper)` includes lower and excludes upper, so adjacent versions
can meet at one boundary without double matching. Assert match count at most one,
not merely choose one with ORDER/LIMIT.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.
- **Independent verification:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 3 — Exclusion versus fallback

With approved `btree_gist`, a partial GiST exclusion combines
`customer_key WITH =` and `valid_period WITH &&` for current system rows.
PostgreSQL enforces conflicts under concurrency. The fallback advisory-lock
trigger qualifies the query and serializes one hashed key before checking;
hash collisions reduce concurrency, and every write path/trigger enablement must
remain controlled.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** The statement completes with the expected command tag, and a catalog or behavior query exposes the named object/rule; no unrelated schema object persists.
- **Independent verification:** Inspect the applicable pgcatalog/informationschema entry and run one valid plus one boundary case inside the lesson's safety boundary.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 4 — Reversal chain

Entries L-1 (+5), L-2 (-5 reversing L-1), and L-3 (+5 correcting/reversing L-2)
sum to +5 without UPDATE. Unique idempotency keys prevent duplicate append and
foreign keys preserve reversal references. Domain policy should prevent
multiple unauthorized reversals of one entry if that is invalid.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.
- **Independent verification:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 5 — Hold decisions

The decision log appends who, reason, action, and time. Current hold state is
derived from the latest authorized decision. Deletion still requires retention
age, no current hold, approval, dependency/backup review, and an immutable
execution audit. The course solution records decisions but deletes nothing.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** The statement completes with the expected command tag, and a catalog or behavior query exposes the named object/rule; no unrelated schema object persists.
- **Independent verification:** Inspect the applicable pgcatalog/informationschema entry and run one valid plus one boundary case inside the lesson's safety boundary.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 6 — Domain assumptions

Record business time zone and clock authority; valid/system boundary convention;
late-arrival/correction authority; allowed gaps/overlaps; customer identity;
money/unit semantics; ledger reconciliation and reversal policy; retention/legal
basis; hold ownership; deletion versus anonymization; and how replicas/backups
honor erasure and audit duties.

### Reasoning and verification

  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 7 — Civil time and daylight saving

Store the authoritative instant as `timestamptz` and retain the IANA zone name
used to interpret/display civil time. A fixed offset has no DST rules; a bare
timestamp cannot identify which occurrence an ambiguous fall-back time means.

Detect/reject nonexistent spring-forward times and require an explicit
earlier/later-offset policy for ambiguous input. Test both transitions for the
supported zone database/version.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.
- **Independent verification:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.

- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 8 — Event, ingestion, and processing clocks

Event time is source occurrence, ingestion time is arrival, and processing time
is computation. A watermark such as maximum observed event time minus allowed
lateness closes windows only under a documented source/partition policy.

Beyond-window data should be quarantined or applied as a versioned
correction/retraction. Publish metric version, as-of/watermark, changed keys, and
downstream recomputation/notification evidence.

- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,

- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 9 — Type-2 as-of dimension join

Give each version a surrogate key, stable business key, half-open effective
range, and correction metadata. Join a fact where business keys match and the
range contains fact time; persist the resolved surrogate when interpretation
must never drift.

Enforce/report no overlap and assert each fact has at most or exactly one match
according to missing-dimension policy. A current flag must agree with range
state.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Independent verification:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** Pre-aggregation or a differently ordered join pipeline is valid only if it prevents fanout and reconciles to the same scoped control total.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 10 — Temporal referential integrity

The child period must be contained by an allowed parent period, not merely share
a key. A trigger can lock a stable business-key namespace, query containment,
and reject gaps under concurrency.

Exclusion constraints prevent overlap but do not alone prove containment.
Deferred/bulk loading needs an explicit validation and quarantine/repair gate;
test parent shrink/delete and concurrent changes.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.

  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.

  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.

- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 11 — Gap and overlap report

Order nonempty periods by lower bound, upper bound, stable ID and compare each
lower bound with the running maximum prior upper. Lower means overlap, greater
means gap, equal means adjacency. Plain `lag(upper)` can miss overlap hidden by
an earlier long interval.

Multirange aggregation/subtraction can expose coverage compactly. Report
duplicates/empty/inverted periods separately and define adjacency policy.

- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 12 — Partition archive under hold

Inventory retention and holds before detach. If one held row blocks an expirable
partition, move/repartition only through audited review. Verify counts/checksums,
dependencies, indexes, encryption/access, manifest, and test restore.

Keep archive discoverable to authorized recovery/legal processes, propagate hold
decisions to replicas/backups, and record deletion evidence. Partition age alone
is not authorization to erase.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.
- **Independent verification:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.

  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.

- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Edge cases

- Infinity/open bounds need explicit API serialization.
- Clock corrections and transaction timestamp versus wall clock differ.
- Backdated facts can change previously published metrics.
- Temporal indexes and history retention grow write/storage cost.
