# cuda-052: Normalization, fusion and memory traffic

## Level and prerequisites

Advanced; about 130 minutes, plus any optional hardware experiment. Direct prerequisites: `cuda-019`, `cuda-029`, `cuda-034`, `cuda-051`

The order supports learning at your own pace. Reading and CPU reasoning remain
available when NVIDIA hardware is absent. Advanced hardware features need their
own capability checks and are not prerequisites for opening this chapter.

## Learning objectives

Explain normalization, fusion and memory traffic using the concrete cases below. Produce an error-budgeted result plus measured bytes/launch reduction and an honest performance comparison.
Distinguish an algorithmic calculation, a compiled artifact and an actual device
observation when explaining what your work establishes.

## Purpose, vocabulary and mental model

Layer normalization centers a row by its mean and divides by a scale derived from variance; RMS normalization uses mean square without subtracting the mean. They are different operations. Epsilon stabilizes the denominator, but placing it inside versus outside a square root changes the formula. Fusion combines operations to avoid intermediates and launches. It can also increase registers, complicate reuse or prevent a good library path. Specify accumulation and output types, normalization axes and learned scale/bias if present. Compare both the mathematical contract and complete pipeline before claiming a fused kernel is better.

## Mathematical contract

\[
y_i=\frac{x_i-\mu}{\sqrt{v+\epsilon}}
\]

This centered population normalization puts epsilon inside the square root. RMS normalization and epsilon outside the root are different formulas.

## How to run and study this lesson

Open this chapter in `/classroom` and use its saved reading worksheet. The primary
reading pad does not execute CUDA. The two examples, six tasks and separate
explanations are usable offline on macOS, Linux and Windows through WSL 2 with
the ordinary classroom. An AMD, Intel or Apple GPU does not make this CUDA C++
source executable through Docker.

For the bounded CPU calculation, select **CPU model (Python)** in this lesson.
That variant keeps its own source and result history under the same chapter. Its
answer-free starter supplies literal fixtures and the task contract; implement
the model and assertions before replacing its deliberate incomplete-work error.
The separate [CPU reference](../references/cuda-052_cpu.py) uses only Python's
standard library. For an optional terminal workflow, run this from the repository
root in a prepared Python environment:

```sh
python courses/cuda/cpp/references/cuda-052_cpu.py
```

The assertions check the stated numerical result or model invariant. Console text
is evidence of this CPU reference only. The [CUDA C++ study workflow](../README.md)
explains optional GPU compilation, paths, hardware requirements and evidence labels.
No lesson opening downloads a model, installs a driver or starts a GPU job.

## Worked example 1: trace the mechanism

For row \([1,3]\), mean is two and population variance is one. With zero epsilon for this nondegenerate demonstration, centered normalized output is \([-1,1]\). RMS normalization instead divides \([1,3]\) by square root of five, giving different noncentered outputs.

The complete CPU model below intentionally models only the named arithmetic,
layout, dependency or capability decision. It does not model GPU scheduling,
caches, instruction timing or device memory visibility.

```python
import math

row = [1.0, 3.0]
mean = sum(row) / len(row)
variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in row) / len(row)
normalized = [(x - mean) / math.sqrt(variance) for x in row]
assert normalized == [-1.0, 1.0]
assert [max(0, x + 1) for x in [-2, 1]] == [0, 2]
print({"layer_normalized": normalized, "RMS_denominator": math.sqrt(5)})
```

**Expected observation:** Every assertion succeeds. A representative CPU output is:

```text
{'layer_normalized': [-1.0, 1.0], 'RMS_denominator': 2.23606797749979}
```

Tiny floating-point display differences across platforms are acceptable only
where the explicit assertions use a tolerance; integers, shapes and ordering
must still satisfy their exact contracts. A printed hypothetical duration is a
model output, not a measured GPU benchmark.

## Worked example 2: change a meaningful condition

For constant \([5,5]\), variance is zero. With positive epsilon inside the square root, centered output is \([0,0]\). A formula that omits epsilon divides zero by zero. Use this case to test stability, but also test low nonzero variance to detect an incorrectly placed epsilon.

Before applying this example to your own program, write down which inputs are
read, which result is produced, and the condition that makes the comparison
valid. Keep the original case as a regression check when changing a boundary.

## Six progressive exercises

### Exercise 1

Predict and trace the first worked example before running its CPU reference. Write every intermediate quantity that leads to the stated result, including units or ownership where applicable.

**Self-check:** Retain the requested calculation, output, diagram or explicit failure policy so another reader can compare it with the worked cases.

**Hint 1:** Start with the literal input and intermediate quantities in worked example 1.

**Hint 2:** Review the mechanism paragraph and the relevant bounded CPU assertion; separate mathematical reasoning from optional device evidence.

### Exercise 2

Reconstruct the second worked example without copying its conclusion. Identify the changed input or condition, show the resulting calculation or dependency, and explain why it differs from the first example.

**Self-check:** Retain the requested calculation, output, diagram or explicit failure policy so another reader can compare it with the worked cases.

**Hint 1:** Identify exactly which condition changes in worked example 2.

**Hint 2:** Review the mechanism paragraph and the relevant bounded CPU assertion; separate mathematical reasoning from optional device evidence.

### Exercise 3

Compute fused bias-plus-ReLU for x=\([-2,1]\), bias=1.

**Self-check:** Retain the requested calculation, output, diagram or explicit failure policy so another reader can compare it with the worked cases.

**Hint 1:** Use the first worked example to establish the relevant quantities, then change only the requested input.

**Hint 2:** Review the mechanism paragraph and the relevant bounded CPU assertion; separate mathematical reasoning from optional device evidence.

### Exercise 4

An implementation uses sample variance instead of population variance. Diagnose it.

**Self-check:** Retain the requested calculation, output, diagram or explicit failure policy so another reader can compare it with the worked cases.

**Hint 1:** Locate the failed phase or violated dependency before proposing a repair.

**Hint 2:** Review the mechanism paragraph and the relevant bounded CPU assertion; separate mathematical reasoning from optional device evidence.

### Exercise 5

What is the singleton centered normalization with positive epsilon?

**Self-check:** Retain the requested calculation, output, diagram or explicit failure policy so another reader can compare it with the worked cases.

**Hint 1:** Check what the algorithm is allowed to read, write or assume at this boundary.

**Hint 2:** Review the mechanism paragraph and the relevant bounded CPU assertion; separate mathematical reasoning from optional device evidence.

### Exercise 6

Estimate one benefit and one cost of fusion.

**Self-check:** Retain the requested calculation, output, diagram or explicit failure policy so another reader can compare it with the worked cases.

**Hint 1:** State the output contract and which observations are needed in the new application.

**Hint 2:** Review the mechanism paragraph and the relevant bounded CPU assertion; separate mathematical reasoning from optional device evidence.

## Common mistakes and diagnosis

A tempting but incorrect claim in this chapter is: **fusion is always faster or the same epsilon convention is interchangeable across formulas.**

For the concrete failure exercise, an implementation uses sample variance instead of population variance. Diagnose it.
Preserve the original input and the stage where behavior diverged. Compare with
the CPU model or dependency diagram before changing hardware configuration.
A compiler result, synthetic timing model, profiler counter and returned numeric
answer support different claims. Record unavailable hardware honestly.

## Self-check, retrieval and transfer

Explain the first example without its code, then use the second example to state
one assumption that matters. Complete Exercise 3 independently, use Exercise 4 to
diagnose a plausible defect, check the boundary in Exercise 5, and retain the
application contract from Exercise 6. Compare the [separate explanations](../solutions/cuda-052_solutions.md)
only after your attempt or a deliberate reveal. A reading marker records your
choice; it does not certify hardware qualification or expert mastery.
