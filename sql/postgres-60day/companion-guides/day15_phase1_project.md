# Day 15 — Phase 1 Project: Multi-Dimensional Revenue Report (Companion Guide)

## Level and prerequisites

- **Level:** Foundation (beginner)
- **Prerequisites:** [Day 14 — numeric types and casting](day14_numeric_and_casting.md)
  and the complete Day 01–14 foundation sequence
- **Artifacts:** [learner SQL](../day15_phase1_project.sql) ·
  [solution reasoning](../solutions/day15_solutions.md) ·
  [executable solution](../solutions/day15_solutions.sql)

## Learning objectives

- Design a multi-dimensional revenue report from a written metric contract.
- Reconcile joins, conditional metrics, subtotals, and time calculations before
  presenting the result.

## Vocabulary and concepts

- **Metric contract:** a written definition of grain, formula, filters, and
  exclusions.
- **Dimensional report:** measures grouped by descriptive attributes such as
  country, category, and month.
- **Control total:** an independently calculated value used for reconciliation.

## Worked example / walkthrough

Build one stable `order_lines` relation first, with one row per intended line or
order and a single net-revenue formula. Reconcile its total, then add dimension
joins one at a time and compare the total after each join. Only after totals
remain stable should you add grouping sets and display labels.

## Exercises

Implement the full project in the [learner SQL](../day15_phase1_project.sql).
Keep a short validation query beside each major CTE and record any intentional
change in represented population.

## Self-check

- Does the grand total equal the independent net-line-revenue control?
- Are date window, payment handling, zero-activity entities, and subtotal
  `NULL`s documented?

## Next step

Continue to [Day 16 — window-function fundamentals](day16_window_functions_fundamentals.md).

## Deep dive and reference

Goal
- Produce a robust monthly revenue report segmented by customer attributes and product categories using techniques from Days 01–14.

What you’ll build
- Extend the supplied monthly segment-country report while retaining its
  revenue, active-customer, and revenue-per-active metrics.
- Add at least two dimensions. The learner script suggests payment method and
  product category.

Guidance
1) Keep product category at line grain before aggregating; it cannot be
   recovered after all lines have been collapsed to one order total.
2) Pre-aggregate payments to the order-method grain before joining to lines.
3) Aggregate by month, segment, country, and the two chosen dimensions.
4) Validate totals against net line revenue and inspect split-payment orders.
5) Document whether all order statuses are included; the starter query does not
   exclude `placed`, `returned`, or any other status.

Quality checklist
- Correct join cardinality (no double counting)
- Handling of NULL/unknown categories and segments
- Performance: indices on join keys; avoid unnecessary DISTINCT

Deliverable from the learner script
- A final query with at least two new dimensions and a short findings write-up
  that documents insights and the payment-allocation/fanout assumptions.
