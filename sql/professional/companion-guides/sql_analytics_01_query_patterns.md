Run from the repository root:

```text
psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d advanced_sql_training -f sql/professional/lessons/sql_analytics_01_query_patterns.sql
```

Every timestamp is explicit and interpreted in UTC for business grouping. The
lab rolls back its fixture.

## How to run this lesson

The rendered lesson page is for reading. PostgreSQL runs the real learner SQL.
For a first attempt, use the private course portal so the database check,
ignored working copy, and complete `psql` transcript remain together.

1. Open a terminal in the repository root. On Windows, double-click
   `START_DS60.cmd` or run:

   ```powershell
   .\START_DS60.cmd
   ```

   On macOS or Linux, run:

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python scripts/learning_portal.py
   ```

2. Open **SQL-ANALYTICS-01 — Reusable Analytical Query Patterns** and choose
   **Create/open guided SQL notebook**. Run its readiness cells from top to
   bottom. The runner accepts only the local disposable
   `advanced_sql_training` database.
3. Read the preparation warning. When you are ready to replace only the
   course-owned training state, set `CONFIRM_COURSE_RESET = True` and run the
   cell. It loads deterministic seed rows, verifies them, and prepares any
   cataloged stateful predecessor.
4. Open and edit the ignored learner copy at
   `.learning/sql/sql-analytics-01/sql_analytics_01_query_patterns.sql`. Save it, then run the notebook's
   full-script cell. It uses `psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f`, preserving
   transaction and `psql` meta-command behavior.
5. Read output directly below the run cell. A `SELECT` prints column headings,
   table-shaped rows, and a row count; DDL/DML prints a command tag; `NOTICE`
   lines explain intentional checks. Success means no unexpected `ERROR`, exit
   code 0, the final cleanup/transaction boundary completes as documented, and the following verification cell passes.

Manual `psql` fallback:

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell, from the repository root
psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d advanced_sql_training -f "sql\professional\lessons\sql_analytics_01_query_patterns.sql"
```

```bash
# macOS/Linux, from the repository root
psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d advanced_sql_training \
  -f sql/professional/lessons/sql_analytics_01_query_patterns.sql
```

The terminal is then the output surface. If PowerShell says `psql` is not
recognized, restart with `START_DS60.cmd`; it can discover PostgreSQL for that
process. If the database or a relation is missing, return to the notebook
preparation cell and explicitly prepare the disposable database. For
authentication failures, rerun setup/doctor—never put a password in SQL, a
notebook, or Git. With `ON_ERROR_STOP`, fix the **first** error and rerun the
whole file instead of trusting partial output.

## A beginner's mental model for this lesson

A **table** stores facts in named columns. A **row** is one occurrence at the
table's declared grain. A query creates a temporary **result set**: rows printed
on screen are not automatically stored. This lesson introduces or reinforces
Grain, Canonical row, Session, Gap/island, Funnel, Attribution window. Its worked SQL reads or creates `pro_analytics_lab.users`, `pro_analytics_lab.events`, `pro_analytics_lab.daily_activity`, `pro_analytics_lab.campaign_touches`, `pro_analytics_lab.tier_history`.

Before writing a query, complete this sentence: “One output row represents
___.” Joins can multiply rows, filters can remove them, grouping can collapse
many rows into one, and window functions can add calculations while preserving
row count. For a normal analytical `SELECT`, use this logical reading order:
`FROM`/`JOIN` (including `ON`) → `WHERE` → `GROUP BY`/aggregates → `HAVING` →
window calculations → `SELECT` → `ORDER BY` → `LIMIT`. PostgreSQL may execute a
different physical plan while preserving those semantics.

The lesson-specific reasoning path is: The raw event grain is one ingestion attempt, so sourceeventid can repeat. The canonical view partitions by source ID and chooses latest ingestedat, then identity as a final tie-break. Deduplication happens before every downstream pattern to avoid double-counting retries.
The expected contract is that the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure. Predict keys, row count, `NULL` behavior,
and ordering before running. Afterwards, compare keys/counts/totals with an
independent control. A blank string, SQL `NULL`, numeric zero, and a missing row
are different facts; use `COALESCE` only after choosing which meaning the
business question requires.

## Two worked SQL examples

These are answer-free worked excerpts from `sql/professional/lessons/sql_analytics_01_query_patterns.sql`. Run the complete file through the guided notebook or `psql` because setup and transaction context can matter.

### Example 1

```sql
CREATE TABLE pro_analytics_lab.users (
    user_id bigint PRIMARY KEY,
    signup_at timestamptz NOT NULL
);
```

**How to read it:** Example 1 is data definition language (DDL). `psql` prints a command tag when PostgreSQL accepts the definition; a later catalog or behavior check must prove that the intended rule exists.

**Expected result/shape:** The output or command tag must match the statement's
declared columns/object and the lesson's stated grain; unexpected duplicates,
missing keys, or an unreported `NULL` require investigation.

### Example 2

```sql
CREATE TABLE pro_analytics_lab.events (
    ingestion_id bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    source_event_id text NOT NULL,
    user_id bigint NOT NULL REFERENCES pro_analytics_lab.users (user_id),
    event_name text NOT NULL,
    event_at timestamptz NOT NULL,
    ingested_at timestamptz NOT NULL
);
```

**How to read it:** Example 2 is data definition language (DDL). `psql` prints a command tag when PostgreSQL accepts the definition; a later catalog or behavior check must prove that the intended rule exists.

**Expected result/shape:** The output or command tag must match the statement's
declared columns/object and the lesson's stated grain; unexpected duplicates,
missing keys, or an unreported `NULL` require investigation.

## Learning objectives

- Implement deterministic deduplication, sessionization, and gaps-and-islands
  patterns.
- Build ordered funnels, bounded last-touch attribution, temporal as-of joins,
  and cohort retention.
- State grain, time-zone/boundary assumptions, tie breaks, denominators, and
  validation queries for each pattern.

## Vocabulary and concepts

- **Grain:** what one input/output row represents.
- **Canonical row:** deterministic winner selected from duplicate versions.
- **Session:** ordered events grouped by an inactivity threshold.
- **Gap/island:** break or consecutive run in ordered values.
- **Funnel:** ordered sequence of qualifying steps.
- **Attribution window:** bounded period in which a touch may receive credit.
- **As-of join:** match fact time to the version valid at that instant.
- **Half-open interval:** includes lower bound and excludes upper `[from,to)`.
- **Cohort:** entities sharing a start period.
- **Retention denominator:** original eligible cohort population, not merely
  users who later returned.

## Worked example / walkthrough

The raw event grain is one ingestion attempt, so `source_event_id` can repeat.
The canonical view partitions by source ID and chooses latest `ingested_at`,
then identity as a final tie-break. Deduplication happens before every downstream
pattern to avoid double-counting retries.

Sessionization orders each user's canonical events, compares with `LAG`, marks a
new session after more than 30 minutes, and cumulatively sums markers. `ROWS`
makes the window frame explicit. The output grain is one user-session.

Gaps and islands subtracts row number from each unique activity date. Consecutive
dates share the same derived key. Duplicate dates must be removed first or they
distort row numbers.

The funnel computes each step only at or after the prior step. Independently
taking each event type's minimum can count out-of-order behavior as conversion.
Output counts retain all signed-up users through LEFT joins.

Attribution starts from each purchase and uses a LEFT LATERAL query for the
latest touch no later than purchase and no earlier than seven days before.
Touch identity breaks timestamp ties. LEFT preserves unattributed purchases.
This is one declared model, not causal proof.

The as-of join uses `valid_from <= event_at` and
`event_at < valid_to`, with NULL as open-ended. A fact exactly at `valid_to`
belongs to the successor row. Production history needs a constraint or test
preventing overlaps; `LIMIT 1` must not hide invalid overlapping versions.

Cohort retention derives UTC signup month, distinct active months, cohort size,
and retained users before division. The denominator remains the starting cohort
size. Month arithmetic is calendar-based, not a fixed number of days.

## Exercises

Complete all fourteen prompts and add fail-fast checks from SQL-TEST-01. For every
query, write input grain, output grain, duplicate rule, time zone, interval
bounds, NULL behavior, and deterministic order before editing SQL.

Treat attribution and retention as definitions that stakeholders must approve,
not universal mathematical truths.

For every answer, state input grain, output grain, duplicate policy, NULL
policy, time zone, half-open bounds, tie-break, and an invariant query:

1. **Deduplication:** prove one canonical row per source event and justify the
   winner order.

   **Verify:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
2. **Sessions:** use a 60-minute rule, calculate duration, and test the exact
   threshold.
   **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.

   **Verify:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
7. **As-of join:** test an event at an upper boundary and require one successor.

   **Verify:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
8. **Trailing window:** use a dense date spine and compare `ROWS` with `RANGE`.

   **Verify:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.

## Self-check

- Does deduplication produce exactly one deterministic row per source event?
- Is the session threshold boundary (`>` versus `>=`) explicit?
- Do islands start from unique ordered dates?
- Can no user reach a funnel step before its predecessor?
- Are unattributed purchases preserved?
- Can an as-of fact match at most one history row?
- Are cohort numerator and denominator independently inspectable?
- Do every final sort and tie-break produce deterministic output?

## Common pitfalls

- Window functions over raw retries silently duplicate sessions and funnels.
- Default window frames can change running calculations when timestamps tie.
- Inner joins discard non-converters and unattributed facts.
- `LIMIT 1` can conceal overlapping temporal history.
- Local-time month boundaries differ from UTC; choose the business zone.
- Funnel minima without step dependency count out-of-order events.
- Last-touch attribution is a convention, not causal impact.
- Retention rates using active users as denominator are not cohort retention.
- Integer division truncates unless one side is numeric.

## Next step

Continue to [SQL-OPS-02 — backup, restore, and recovery rehearsals](sql_ops_02_backup_restore_recovery.md).
Use the contract-test module to freeze each analytical definition and add
edge-case fixtures before turning a pattern into a metric.

## Ask Codex about this lesson

Codex is optional; the guide, learner SQL, PostgreSQL, and expected checks are
enough to complete the lesson offline. If you want a patient tutor, copy this
prompt after opening the repository in Codex:

```text
Tutor me through sql-analytics-01 — Reusable Analytical Query Patterns.

I am a complete beginner. Use these checked-in sources:
- Guide: sql/professional/companion-guides/sql_analytics_01_query_patterns.md
- Answer-free learner SQL: sql/professional/lessons/sql_analytics_01_query_patterns.sql

The lesson concepts include Grain, Canonical row, Session, Gap/island, Funnel, Attribution window. First define those terms in plain
language and explain table, row, column, result set, row grain, SQL NULL, and
deterministic ordering where they apply. Then explain the important clauses in
logical order and state the expected row grain/shape before asking me to run
anything. The guide's lesson-specific worked-model focus is: The raw event grain is one ingestion attempt, so sourceeventid can repeat. The canonical view partitions by source ID and chooses latest ingestedat, then identity as a final tie-break. Deduplication happens before every downstream pattern to avoid double-counting retries.

Use only the local disposable advanced_sql_training database. Prefer the
lesson reader's Create/open guided SQL notebook action and its ignored
.learning/sql/sql-analytics-01/ working copy. Never point setup, reset, DDL, or DML
at a shared or valuable database, and never ask me to paste a password.

Follow guide -> prediction -> my attempt -> one progressive hint at a time ->
solution comparison. Do not open, quote, or summarize an official solution
unless I explicitly ask after attempting the exercise. Ask for my actual SQL
and the complete psql transcript/query result; inspect that evidence rather
than assuming a completion declaration proves mastery. Explain the first error
before changing later code. Finish with 2-3 retrieval questions and one small
transfer task that I answer without looking back.
