## Level and prerequisites

- **Level:** Advanced
- **Prerequisites:** Run and verify committed
  [Day 52 — star-schema warehouse](day52_project3_dwh_part1.md) in the same
  database.
- **Artifacts:** [learner SQL](../day53_project3_dwh_part2_scd.sql) ·
  [solution reasoning](../solutions/day53_solutions.md) ·
  [executable solution](../solutions/day53_solutions.sql)

## How to run this lesson

The rendered lesson page is for reading. PostgreSQL runs the real learner SQL.
For a first attempt, use the private course portal so the database check,
ignored working copy, and complete `psql` transcript remain together.

1. Open a terminal in the repository root. On Windows, double-click
   `START_DS60.cmd` or run:

   ```powershell
   .\START_DS60.cmd
   ```

   On macOS or Linux, run:

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python scripts/learning_portal.py
   ```

2. Open **SQL-53 — Project3 DWH Part2 SCD** and choose
   **Create/open guided SQL notebook**. Run its readiness cells from top to
   bottom. The runner accepts only the local disposable
   `advanced_sql_training` database.
3. Read the preparation warning. When you are ready to replace only the
   course-owned training state, set `CONFIRM_COURSE_RESET = True` and run the
   cell. It loads deterministic seed rows, verifies them, and prepares any
   cataloged stateful predecessor.
4. Open and edit the ignored learner copy at
   `.learning/sql/sql-53/day53_project3_dwh_part2_scd.sql`. Save it, then run the notebook's
   full-script cell. It uses `psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f`, preserving
   transaction and `psql` meta-command behavior.
5. Read output directly below the run cell. A `SELECT` prints column headings,
   table-shaped rows, and a row count; DDL/DML prints a command tag; `NOTICE`
   lines explain intentional checks. Success means no unexpected `ERROR`, exit
   code 0, the final cleanup/transaction boundary completes as documented, and the following verification cell passes.

This lesson requires the committed Day 52 warehouse. The guided preparation cell resolves that cataloged predecessor. For a direct terminal run, execute Day 52 successfully first; do not assume a rolled-back Day 53 exercise persists into Day 54.

Manual `psql` fallback:

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell, from the repository root
psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d advanced_sql_training -f "sql\postgres-60day\day53_project3_dwh_part2_scd.sql"
```

```bash
# macOS/Linux, from the repository root
psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d advanced_sql_training \
  -f sql/postgres-60day/day53_project3_dwh_part2_scd.sql
```

The terminal is then the output surface. If PowerShell says `psql` is not
recognized, restart with `START_DS60.cmd`; it can discover PostgreSQL for that
process. If the database or a relation is missing, return to the notebook
preparation cell and explicitly prepare the disposable database. For
authentication failures, rerun setup/doctor—never put a password in SQL, a
notebook, or Git. With `ON_ERROR_STOP`, fix the **first** error and rerun the
whole file instead of trusting partial output.

## A beginner's mental model for this lesson

A **table** stores facts in named columns. A **row** is one occurrence at the
table's declared grain. A query creates a temporary **result set**: rows printed
on screen are not automatically stored. This lesson introduces or reinforces
SCD Type 2, Business key, Validity interval. Its worked SQL reads or creates `training.customers`, `dim_customer`, `training.products`, `dim_product`.

Before writing a query, complete this sentence: “One output row represents
___.” Joins can multiply rows, filters can remove them, grouping can collapse
many rows into one, and window functions can add calculations while preserving
row count. For a normal analytical `SELECT`, use this logical reading order:
`FROM`/`JOIN` (including `ON`) → `WHERE` → `GROUP BY`/aggregates → `HAVING` →
window calculations → `SELECT` → `ORDER BY` → `LIMIT`. PostgreSQL may execute a
different physical plan while preserving those semantics.

The lesson-specific reasoning path is: For one changed customer, locate exactly one current row, set its validto to the day before the new version, and insert the successor at CURRENTDATE. Then as-of join a fact date using inclusive bounds and verify it resolves to one surrogate key—not zero and not two.
The expected contract is that the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure. Predict keys, row count, `NULL` behavior,
and ordering before running. Afterwards, compare keys/counts/totals with an
independent control. A blank string, SQL `NULL`, numeric zero, and a missing row
are different facts; use `COALESCE` only after choosing which meaning the
business question requires.

## Two worked SQL examples

These are answer-free worked excerpts from `sql/postgres-60day/day53_project3_dwh_part2_scd.sql`. Run the complete file through the guided notebook or `psql` because setup and transaction context can matter.

### Example 1

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE changed_customers AS
SELECT c.customer_id,
       c.full_name,
       c.country,
       CASE WHEN c.segment = 'platinum' THEN 'gold' ELSE 'platinum' END AS segment
FROM training.customers c
ORDER BY c.customer_id
LIMIT 10;
```

**How to read it:** Example 1 is data definition language (DDL). `psql` prints a command tag when PostgreSQL accepts the definition; a later catalog or behavior check must prove that the intended rule exists.

**Expected result/shape:** The output or command tag must match the statement's
declared columns/object and the lesson's stated grain; unexpected duplicates,
missing keys, or an unreported `NULL` require investigation.

### Example 2

```sql
WITH current_dim AS (
  SELECT dc.*
  FROM dim_customer dc
  WHERE dc.is_current
), diffs AS (
  SELECT s.customer_id,
         s.full_name,
         s.country,
         s.segment
  FROM changed_customers s
  JOIN current_dim dc ON dc.customer_id = s.customer_id
  WHERE coalesce(s.full_name,'') <> coalesce(dc.full_name,'')
     OR coalesce(s.country,'')   <> coalesce(dc.country,'')
     OR coalesce(s.segment,'')   <> coalesce(dc.segment,'')
), closed AS (
  UPDATE dim_customer dc
  SET valid_to = CURRENT_DATE - 1,
      is_current = FALSE
  FROM diffs d
  WHERE dc.customer_id = d.customer_id
    AND dc.is_current
  RETURNING dc.customer_id
)
INSERT INTO dim_customer(customer_id, full_name, country, segment, valid_from, valid_to, is_current)
SELECT d.customer_id, d.full_name, d.country, d.segment, CURRENT_DATE, NULL, TRUE
FROM diffs d;
```

**How to read it:** Example 2 returns a table-shaped result. Read `FROM`/`JOIN` as the input relation, then filters, grouping or windows, and finally the selected columns. Predict the keys before running it; A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.

**Expected result/shape:** The output or command tag must match the statement's
declared columns/object and the lesson's stated grain; unexpected duplicates,
missing keys, or an unreported `NULL` require investigation.

## Learning objectives

- Close one current dimension version and insert its successor atomically.
- Resolve facts to the dimension version valid on their event date.

## Vocabulary and concepts

- **SCD Type 2:** slowly changing dimension design that preserves version
  history as new rows.
- **Business key:** stable source identity shared by all versions.
- **Validity interval:** the dates or timestamps for which one version applies.

## Worked example / walkthrough

For one changed customer, locate exactly one current row, set its `valid_to` to
the day before the new version, and insert the successor at `CURRENT_DATE`.
Then as-of join a fact date using inclusive bounds and verify it resolves to one
surrogate key—not zero and not two.

## Exercises

Complete these in the [learner SQL](../day53_project3_dwh_part2_scd.sql):

1. Map facts to the effective SCD Type 2 version.
   **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.
   **Verify:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
2. Add/set audit columns on inserts and closes.
   **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.
   **Verify:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
3. Diagnose same-day date-grain version closure.
   **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.
   **Verify:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
4. Detect overlapping effective ranges per natural key.
   **Expected result/shape:** Evidence of the incorrect behavior followed by a corrected result at the declared grain, with the violated invariant made visible.
   **Verify:** Keep a minimal failing case, rerun the corrected form, and compare keys/counts/totals so the repair is proved rather than asserted.
5. Make an unchanged-source rerun idempotent.
   **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.
   **Verify:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
6. Define a same-day change sequence policy.
   **Expected result/shape:** The statement completes with the expected command tag, and a catalog or behavior query exposes the named object/rule; no unrelated schema object persists.
   **Verify:** Inspect the applicable `pg_catalog`/`information_schema` entry and run one valid plus one boundary case inside the lesson's safety boundary.

Check multiple-current versions, gaps, and overlaps.

## Self-check

- Are close and insert operations in one atomic transaction?
- Does temporal fact mapping preserve the source fact count exactly?

## Next step

Continue in the same database to
[Day 54 — warehouse aggregates](day54_project3_dwh_part3_aggregations.md).

## Deep dive and reference

## Project focus

- Detect changed customer and product attributes.
- Close the old current row and insert a new version.
- Map historical facts to the dimension version valid on the fact date.

## Preconditions and state

Run Day 52 first in the same database. Day 53 reads the committed `dwh` schema
but performs its changes inside a transaction and rolls them back.

The learner stages deterministic changes for ten customers and ten products.
For each changed business key, the current row closes at `CURRENT_DATE - 1`,
and the replacement starts at `CURRENT_DATE`.

## Practice — match the learner prompts exactly

1. Rebuild or test fact-key mapping with an as-of join:
   `valid_from <= order_date <= COALESCE(valid_to, infinity)` for both customer
   and product versions.
2. Add `updated_by` and `updated_at` to both changing dimensions, and stamp
   close/insert operations deliberately.

## SCD reasoning

- Close and insert are one atomic transaction.
- `customer_id` and `product_id` are business keys; their surrogate keys identify
  versions.
- Inclusive bounds require the old row to end one day before the new row starts.
- A production dimension should prevent more than one current row per business
  key and overlapping validity ranges.

## Validation and limits

- Temporal fact mapping count must equal source item count.
- A lower count signals a date/version gap; a higher count signals overlapping
  versions.
- Audit defaults cover inserts but do not explain update actors; set them on
  close operations too.
- The course uses date-grain validity. Timestamp-effective changes require a
  different boundary model.

## Ask Codex about this lesson

Codex is optional; the guide, learner SQL, PostgreSQL, and expected checks are
enough to complete the lesson offline. If you want a patient tutor, copy this
prompt after opening the repository in Codex:

```text
Tutor me through sql-53 — Project3 DWH Part2 SCD.

I am a complete beginner. Use these checked-in sources:
- Guide: sql/postgres-60day/companion-guides/day53_project3_dwh_part2_scd.md
- Answer-free learner SQL: sql/postgres-60day/day53_project3_dwh_part2_scd.sql

The lesson concepts include SCD Type 2, Business key, Validity interval. First define those terms in plain
language and explain table, row, column, result set, row grain, SQL NULL, and
deterministic ordering where they apply. Then explain the important clauses in
logical order and state the expected row grain/shape before asking me to run
anything. The guide's lesson-specific worked-model focus is: For one changed customer, locate exactly one current row, set its validto to the day before the new version, and insert the successor at CURRENTDATE. Then as-of join a fact date using inclusive bounds and verify it resolves to one surrogate key—not zero and not two.

Use only the local disposable advanced_sql_training database. Prefer the
lesson reader's Create/open guided SQL notebook action and its ignored
.learning/sql/sql-53/ working copy. Never point setup, reset, DDL, or DML
at a shared or valuable database, and never ask me to paste a password.

Follow guide -> prediction -> my attempt -> one progressive hint at a time ->
solution comparison. Do not open, quote, or summarize an official solution
unless I explicitly ask after attempting the exercise. Ask for my actual SQL
and the complete psql transcript/query result; inspect that evidence rather
than assuming a completion declaration proves mastery. Explain the first error
before changing later code. Finish with 2-3 retrieval questions and one small
transfer task that I answer without looking back.
