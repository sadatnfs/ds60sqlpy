# SQL-REPL-01 Solutions — Replication, CDC, and HA


<!-- beginner-solution-enrichment -->
## How to study and run this solution

Open this explanation only after making an honest attempt. The executable
companion runs solely against the disposable `advanced_sql_training` database:

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell, from the repository root
psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d advanced_sql_training -f "sql\professional\solutions\sql_repl_01_cdc_high_availability_solutions.sql"
```

```bash
# macOS/Linux, from the repository root
psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d advanced_sql_training \
  -f sql/professional/solutions/sql_repl_01_cdc_high_availability_solutions.sql
```

`psql` prints each result/command tag in the terminal. Stop at the first
unexpected `ERROR`; later output cannot repair an earlier failed invariant.
Compare your own SQL, row grain, column names, row counts, `NULL` policy, and
ordering with the explanation before comparing syntax.

## Clause-by-clause reading map

The lesson's main concepts are WAL, Physical replication, Logical replication, CDC, Transactional outbox, Inbox/idempotency key. Its worked-model focus is:
The capability query reports WAL level and counts only; it does not print slot, publication, subscription, host, or query identities. Counts can still require monitoring privileges on managed services. Capability settings are evidence, not authorization to mutate them.

- Start at `FROM`/`JOIN` and state the intermediate row grain. Inspect join keys
  before adding aggregates; a one-to-many join is allowed to multiply rows only
  when the later contract accounts for it.
- Apply `WHERE` to input rows, `GROUP BY` to form buckets, and `HAVING` to
  completed groups. Window functions run over the surviving relation and
  normally preserve its row count.
- Read the `SELECT` list as the public result contract: keys establish grain,
  measures state calculations, and aliases explain meaning. `ORDER BY` is the
  only output-order guarantee; add a unique tie-breaker before `LIMIT`.
- Trace every common table expression (CTE) as a temporary named relation.
  Execute or inspect one stage at a time while debugging, but compare the final
  result with an independent control rather than trusting stage names.
- Keep SQL `NULL` as “missing/unknown/not applicable” until the metric contract
  chooses another representation. Guard division with `NULLIF`; disclose
  exclusions and distinguish zero from no row.
- For DDL/DML, a command tag proves only that PostgreSQL accepted a statement.
  Catalog checks, negative cases, row-count reconciliation, and the declared
  transaction boundary prove behavior and cleanup.

The exact final queries are not the only valid syntax. A join, subquery, CTE,
window, or conditional aggregate can be an alternative when it preserves the
same grain, `NULL` semantics, deterministic ordering, and safety. Prefer the
form whose intermediate relations a reviewer can verify; optimize only after
correctness is established with evidence.

Run:

```text
psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d advanced_sql_training -f sql/professional/solutions/sql_repl_01_cdc_high_availability_solutions.sql
```

The solution creates no replication objects and rolls back.

## Exercise 1 — Publisher crash

Commit business state and outbox intent together. A crash before publisher
acknowledgement leaves `published=false`; a later worker discovers it. Mark
published only after durable downstream acknowledgement. Monitor old
unpublished rows and retry with backoff/ownership.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.
- **Independent verification:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 2 — Consumer uncertainty

Inbox plus projection is atomic when both live in one database transaction.
For an external API, send `event_id` as an idempotency key to a service that
durably stores it and returns the original result on retry. After a timeout,
query/reconcile by key; do not assume failure means no effect. Bind the key to a
canonical request fingerprint and reject key reuse with different content.

- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 3 — Ordering and gaps

The executable delivers v3 before v2. The projection update condition accepts
only a greater aggregate version, so v2 cannot regress v3. Inbox contains
versions 2 and 3; comparing with generated contiguous versions reveals the
missing v1 gap. Policy may pause/replay, fetch a canonical snapshot, or accept a
documented compaction—not silently ignore it.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** Evidence of the incorrect behavior followed by a corrected result at the declared grain, with the violated invariant made visible.
- **Independent verification:** Keep a minimal failing case, rerun the corrected form, and compare keys/counts/totals so the repair is proved rather than asserted.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 4 — Physical versus logical

Physical replication streams WAL/storage changes for the cluster and supports
standby recovery; it needs compatible PostgreSQL/storage/extensions. Logical
replication decodes selected table DML through publication/subscription and can
support version/platform differences, but schema DDL, sequences, large objects,
and conflict policy need separate handling.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A written prediction plus the actual query/plan output, including the compared row counts, keys, measures, or SQLSTATE named by the prompt.
- **Independent verification:** Run both cases with the same inputs, record the observed difference, and revise the explanation if evidence contradicts the prediction.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 5 — Slot operations

Track slot owner/consumer, active state, restart/confirmed LSN, retained WAL
bytes versus disk budget, consumer lag/rate, last success, and alert/runbook
threshold. Confirm consumer decommission or new restart position before
dropping a slot. A disconnected but recoverable consumer may still need retained
WAL.

  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.

- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 6 — Failover

Detect with quorum-aware health, fence the old writer, determine replay/loss
against RPO, promote one target, update routing, reconnect clients with retry,
verify data/application/slots/subscribers, establish a new replica and backup,
and record the new timeline. Define abort/rollback boundaries before promotion;
after divergent writes, “fail back” is reconciliation, not a simple switch.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.

  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.

- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 7 — Publication and replica identity contract

Publish only reviewed rows/columns and test inserts, updates crossing the row
filter, deletes, NULL boundaries, and every tenant. UPDATE/DELETE need a replica
identity that identifies the old row—usually a suitable primary key; FULL
increases WAL and has limitations.

Logical replication does not automatically maintain sequence state or replicate
general DDL. Filtering defines movement scope, not subscriber authorization, so
test for leaks end to end.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.

- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,

- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 8 — Snapshot-to-stream bootstrap

Create/own the slot and exported snapshot, record its start LSN, read initial
data under that snapshot, then consume from the matching position before
handoff. Deduplicate by stable source identity and checkpoint only durable work.

Monitor retained WAL versus disk. On abandonment, prove no consumer needs the
slot before cleanup; an orphan slot is a disk-growth hazard.

  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.

  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 9 — Read-after-write on replicas

Define user-visible consistency: immediate own-write visibility, maximum
staleness, or best effort. Compare primary pinning, a commit-LSN token and replay
wait, bounded-lag routing, and timeout fallback.

Byte/time lag does not prove one transaction is visible. Observe replay LSN and
application caches, cap waits, and specify paused-replay/failover behavior.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A written prediction plus the actual query/plan output, including the compared row counts, keys, measures, or SQLSTATE named by the prompt.
- **Independent verification:** Run both cases with the same inputs, record the observed difference, and revise the explanation if evidence contradicts the prediction.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.

- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 10 — Multi-writer conflicts

Wall clocks skew, so last timestamp wins can discard a causally later change.
Prefer single-writer ownership; otherwise use expected versions, deterministic
domain merge, and quarantine irreconcilable conflicts with source evidence.

Do not advance checkpoints silently past unresolved data. Provide canonical
snapshot/replay repair, idempotency, authorization, and an audit of the choice.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A written prediction plus the actual query/plan output, including the compared row counts, keys, measures, or SQLSTATE named by the prompt.

  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.

  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.

- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 11 — DDL compatibility sequencing

Matrix publisher, subscriber, decoder/apply, and old/new application schemas.
Add nullable columns first, deploy tolerant readers/writers, backfill/reconcile,
validate constraints, and remove only after every consumer stops using old
shape.

Defaults, generated values, replica identity, types, row filters, and column
lists need explicit tests. DDL requires its own ordered deployment channel.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** The statement completes with the expected command tag, and a catalog or behavior query exposes the named object/rule; no unrelated schema object persists.
- **Independent verification:** Inspect the applicable pgcatalog/informationschema entry and run one valid plus one boundary case inside the lesson's safety boundary.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 12 — Failback and reseed

Protect a verified new-primary backup and keep the old primary fenced. Compare
timelines/LSNs and use rewind only when prerequisites/WAL exist; otherwise
rebuild. Recreate and verify replicas, slots, subscriptions, and checkpoints.

Before routing writes, reconcile data and critical queries, establish backup/HA,
monitor retry/lag/conflicts, and record authority/evidence. A diverged former
primary cannot be restored by reversing DNS.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** The statement completes with the expected command tag, and a catalog or behavior query exposes the named object/rule; no unrelated schema object persists.
- **Independent verification:** Inspect the applicable pgcatalog/informationschema entry and run one valid plus one boundary case inside the lesson's safety boundary.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.

- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Edge cases

- Poison events need quarantine without blocking every later aggregate forever.
- Publisher concurrency needs leases/locks and retry visibility.
- Synchronous replication trades latency/availability for lower acknowledged
  data-loss risk.
- Logical subscriber conflicts require explicit ownership.
