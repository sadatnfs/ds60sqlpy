# SQL-TEST-01 Solutions — Contracts and Migration Checks


<!-- beginner-solution-enrichment -->
## How to study and run this solution

Open this explanation only after making an honest attempt. The executable
companion runs solely against the disposable `advanced_sql_training` database:

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell, from the repository root
psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d advanced_sql_training -f "sql\professional\solutions\sql_test_01_contracts_migrations_solutions.sql"
```

```bash
# macOS/Linux, from the repository root
psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d advanced_sql_training \
  -f sql/professional/solutions/sql_test_01_contracts_migrations_solutions.sql
```

`psql` prints each result/command tag in the terminal. Stop at the first
unexpected `ERROR`; later output cannot repair an earlier failed invariant.
Compare your own SQL, row grain, column names, row counts, `NULL` policy, and
ordering with the explanation before comparing syntax.

## Clause-by-clause reading map

The lesson's main concepts are Assertion, Fixture, Negative control, Contract, Invariant test, Reconciliation. Its worked-model focus is:
asserttrue(name, condition, detail) treats both false and NULL as failure, raises an exception, and emits a PASS notice only after success. With ONERRORSTOP=1, an uncaught failed assertion gives the command a nonzero exit status—CI cannot mistake printed warnings for success.

- Start at `FROM`/`JOIN` and state the intermediate row grain. Inspect join keys
  before adding aggregates; a one-to-many join is allowed to multiply rows only
  when the later contract accounts for it.
- Apply `WHERE` to input rows, `GROUP BY` to form buckets, and `HAVING` to
  completed groups. Window functions run over the surviving relation and
  normally preserve its row count.
- Read the `SELECT` list as the public result contract: keys establish grain,
  measures state calculations, and aliases explain meaning. `ORDER BY` is the
  only output-order guarantee; add a unique tie-breaker before `LIMIT`.
- Trace every common table expression (CTE) as a temporary named relation.
  Execute or inspect one stage at a time while debugging, but compare the final
  result with an independent control rather than trusting stage names.
- Keep SQL `NULL` as “missing/unknown/not applicable” until the metric contract
  chooses another representation. Guard division with `NULLIF`; disclose
  exclusions and distinguish zero from no row.
- For DDL/DML, a command tag proves only that PostgreSQL accepted a statement.
  Catalog checks, negative cases, row-count reconciliation, and the declared
  transaction boundary prove behavior and cleanup.

The exact final queries are not the only valid syntax. A join, subquery, CTE,
window, or conditional aggregate can be an alternative when it preserves the
same grain, `NULL` semantics, deterministic ordering, and safety. Prefer the
form whose intermediate relations a reviewer can verify; optimize only after
correctness is established with evidence.

Run:

```text
psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d advanced_sql_training -f sql/professional/solutions/sql_test_01_contracts_migrations_solutions.sql
```

The solution rolls back its schema and uses only PostgreSQL catalogs.

## Exercise 1 — Migration and currency contract

The exact manifest is `ARRAY[1,2,3]`. The column contract checks information
schema type `character`, length 3, `NOT NULL`, and a USD default. A production
contract should additionally define ISO vocabulary, conversion policy, and
whether totals may combine currencies.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** The statement completes with the expected command tag, and a catalog or behavior query exposes the named object/rule; no unrelated schema object persists.
- **Independent verification:** Inspect the applicable pgcatalog/informationschema entry and run one valid plus one boundary case inside the lesson's safety boundary.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** An alternative physical/object design is valid only if catalog inspection and valid/invalid behavior prove the same invariant.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 2 — Duplicate producer keys

The detail query returns one row per duplicate key group and labels its count
`participating_rows`. The summary wraps that query and expects one duplicate
group. Counting all rows with a window would answer a different grain.

Raw staging intentionally permits duplicates so the contract test can observe
them. Curated storage should add the appropriate key only after a duplicate
resolution policy is explicit.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.
- **Independent verification:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 3 — Constraint contracts

The solution searches `pg_constraint` by schema, relation, type, and rendered
definition rather than relying on an auto-generated name. A more rigorous
helper can inspect `conkey` attribute numbers directly. Test semantic properties
while allowing harmless naming differences.

Primary keys, foreign keys, checks, defaults, ownership, privileges, indexes,
and RLS policies may all be part of a migration contract.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.
- **Independent verification:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** An alternative physical/object design is valid only if catalog inspection and valid/invalid behavior prove the same invariant.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 4 — Zero-line reconciliation

A LEFT JOIN retains orders with no line aggregate. `COALESCE(line_total, 0)`
implements the stated rule that no lines sum to numeric zero. Without that
business rule, missing may need to remain NULL and fail separately. `IS
DISTINCT FROM` compares NULL safely.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.
- **Independent verification:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 5 — Harness reasoning

Fixtures belong to this test module, carry deterministic keys/content tags, and
live in a rollback-isolated schema. A negative control proves failure detection.
CI requires raised errors plus `ON_ERROR_STOP=1`; human-readable failure rows
alone can still exit zero.

Tests must never reset production/shared schemas. Use a disposable database,
per-run schema/database, or transaction whose code does not require commits.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** Evidence of the incorrect behavior followed by a corrected result at the declared grain, with the violated invariant made visible.
- **Independent verification:** Keep a minimal failing case, rerun the corrected form, and compare keys/counts/totals so the repair is proved rather than asserted.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 6 — Assert the intended error

Wrap the duplicate insert in a nested block, require `unique_violation`
(SQLSTATE `23505`), and raise if the insert succeeds. Optionally inspect
`CONSTRAINT_NAME` with `GET STACKED DIAGNOSTICS` when the exact stable constraint
is contractual; do not accept every integrity error as proof of this rule.

Full server messages vary with version, locale, detail, and object names.
Matching them makes tests brittle, while `WHEN OTHERS` can falsely pass on
permissions, missing objects, or syntax defects.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.
- **Independent verification:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 7 — Table-driven boundaries

Represent cases as rows with case ID, input fields, and expected accept/reject
or normalized result. Cover just below, exact, and just above numeric/date
bounds; NULL versus empty; Unicode normalization/case/length; malformed values;
and arithmetic overflow/rounding.

Execute each case in an isolated subtransaction when rejection is expected and
record observed SQLSTATE. Finally assert every case ran exactly once and matched
its expected outcome so an accidentally filtered case cannot disappear.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.
- **Independent verification:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** An alternative physical/object design is valid only if catalog inspection and valid/invalid behavior prove the same invariant.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 8 — Deterministic concurrency test

Use two independent sessions because one PostgreSQL transaction cannot observe
every competing-transaction anomaly. Establish fixture state, set short
`lock_timeout`/`statement_timeout`, coordinate named barriers, perform the
interleaving, commit/rollback explicitly, and assert final rows plus errors.

Avoid arbitrary sleeps as the only synchronization—they create flaky tests.
Use locks/advisory barriers or a harness that waits for observable session state,
capture both session logs, and always clean a disposable target after failure.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.
- **Independent verification:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** A shorter formulation is valid only when it preserves the same grain, NULL behavior, deterministic order, and transaction boundary.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 9 — Stable schema fingerprint

Canonicalize ordered semantic rows for columns/types/defaults/nullability,
constraints and referenced columns, indexes/predicates/operator classes,
privileges/policies, and routine signatures/attributes. Compare expected and
observed rows directly before hashing so drift remains diagnosable.

Exclude OIDs, relation file identifiers, statistics, timestamps, and
auto-generated names unless explicitly contractual. Test both missing and
unexpected objects; a one-way expected-subset check misses accidental exposure.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** The statement completes with the expected command tag, and a catalog or behavior query exposes the named object/rule; no unrelated schema object persists.
- **Independent verification:** Inspect the applicable pgcatalog/informationschema entry and run one valid plus one boundary case inside the lesson's safety boundary.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.
- **Alternative/trade-off:** An alternative physical/object design is valid only if catalog inspection and valid/invalid behavior prove the same invariant.
- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Exercise 10 — Destructive migration rehearsal

Restore a representative, access-isolated backup to a disposable database,
record tool/server versions and baseline contracts, run the exact migration,
then reconcile counts/checksums/rejected keys and execute critical read/write
queries with compatible application versions.

Measure locks, WAL, lag proxy, storage, and elapsed time. Determine whether
rollback preserves new writes or whether recovery requires restore/forward fix.
Archive results, approvals, cleanup, gaps, and owners; never infer production
permission from a successful course fixture.

### Reasoning and verification

- **Expected result/shape:** A table-shaped result containing every key/measure named in the prompt; the result must preserve the row grain described in the walkthrough and expose every named key or measure.
- **Independent verification:** Check uniqueness at the declared grain, deterministic ordering when rows are ranked/limited, and reconcile counts or totals to a simpler control query over the same population.
- **Intermediate relation check:** Run or inspect each CTE/subquery from the
  inside out. Record its keys and row count; the first stage that violates the
  declared grain is where debugging begins.
- **Clause check:** Explain why every `ON`, `WHERE`, grouping, window frame,
  projection, and final sort belongs where it is. Moving a predicate can change
  preserved rows; removing a tie-breaker can make output nondeterministic.

- **Edge case:** Recheck empty input, one qualifying row, `NULL` in a relevant
  value/key, duplicate join keys, and tied ordering values. State which cases
  are impossible because of a database constraint and which the query handles.

## Edge cases

- DDL that commits externally cannot be isolated by one rollback.
- Concurrent migration runners need serialization.
- Information-schema types can differ from domain/underlying type expectations.
- Reconciliation tolerances need explicit units and rounding rules.
