# cuda-007: From elapsed time to a performance model

## Level and prerequisites

Beginner; about 90 minutes, plus any optional hardware experiment. Direct prerequisites: `cuda-001`, `cuda-005`, `cuda-006`

The order supports learning at your own pace. Reading and CPU reasoning remain
available when NVIDIA hardware is absent. Advanced hardware features need their
own capability checks and are not prerequisites for opening this chapter.

## Learning objectives

Explain from elapsed time to a performance model using the concrete cases below. Produce a units-correct model and an experiment that could disprove it.
Distinguish an algorithmic calculation, a compiled artifact and an actual device
observation when explaining what your work establishes.

## Purpose, vocabulary and mental model

Arithmetic intensity measures operations per byte of data movement under an explicitly stated memory model. A roofline estimate limits performance by the smaller of arithmetic capacity and bandwidth times intensity. It is an upper bound, not a timer. Vector addition reads two float32 values and writes one for one addition, giving roughly one operation per twelve useful bytes before cache and transaction effects. Matrix multiplication can reuse each loaded value many times; tiling increases reuse but consumes working storage. Launch cost, transfer cost, dependency stalls and imperfect access patterns can keep measured work far below either bound.

## Mathematical contract

\[
P\leq\min(P_{\mathrm{peak}},B I)
\]

P is operations per second, B is bytes per second, and I is operations per byte under the stated traffic model. This bound omits fixed overhead and many implementation effects.

## How to run and study this lesson

Open this chapter in `/classroom` and use its saved reading worksheet. The primary
reading pad does not execute CUDA. The two examples, six tasks and separate
explanations are usable offline on macOS, Linux and Windows through WSL 2 with
the ordinary classroom. An AMD, Intel or Apple GPU does not make this CUDA C++
source executable through Docker.

For the bounded CPU calculation, select **CPU model (Python)** in this lesson.
That variant keeps its own source and result history under the same chapter. Its
answer-free starter supplies literal fixtures and the task contract; implement
the model and assertions before replacing its deliberate incomplete-work error.
The separate [CPU reference](../references/cuda-007_cpu.py) uses only Python's
standard library. For an optional terminal workflow, run this from the repository
root in a prepared Python environment:

```sh
python courses/cuda/cpp/references/cuda-007_cpu.py
```

The assertions check the stated numerical result or model invariant. Console text
is evidence of this CPU reference only. The [CUDA C++ study workflow](../README.md)
explains optional GPU compilation, paths, hardware requirements and evidence labels.
No lesson opening downloads a model, installs a driver or starts a GPU job.

## Worked example 1: trace the mechanism

Assume hypothetical bandwidth of 600 GB/s, using decimal billions, and a 12-byte-per-element vector addition. The ideal useful-element throughput is 50 billion elements/s. One million elements require at least 20 microseconds at that bandwidth, excluding launch and host transfer. This is a thought experiment, not a claim about the learner's GPU.

The complete CPU model below intentionally models only the named arithmetic,
layout, dependency or capability decision. It does not model GPU scheduling,
caches, instruction timing or device memory visibility.

```python
n, bytes_per_element, bandwidth = 1_000_000, 12, 600e9
seconds = n * bytes_per_element / bandwidth
assert abs(seconds - 20e-6) < 1e-15
limits = [min(10e12, intensity * 500e9) for intensity in (2, 40)]
assert limits == [1e12, 10e12]
print({"ideal_memory_seconds": seconds, "roofline_flops_per_second": limits})
```

**Expected observation:** Every assertion succeeds. A representative CPU output is:

```text
{'ideal_memory_seconds': 2e-05, 'roofline_flops_per_second': [1000000000000.0, 10000000000000.0]}
```

Tiny floating-point display differences across platforms are acceptable only
where the explicit assertions use a tolerance; integers, shapes and ordering
must still satisfy their exact contracts. A printed hypothetical duration is a
model output, not a measured GPU benchmark.

## Worked example 2: change a meaningful condition

A hypothetical device has 10 TFLOP/s arithmetic capacity and 500 GB/s bandwidth. At intensity 2 FLOP/byte the roofline is 1 TFLOP/s; at intensity 40 it is capped at 10 TFLOP/s. Increasing reuse can change the limiting resource, but a kernel must still expose sufficient independent work.

Before applying this example to your own program, write down which inputs are
read, which result is produced, and the condition that makes the comparison
valid. Keep the original case as a regression check when changing a boundary.

## Six progressive exercises

### Exercise 1

Predict and trace the first worked example before running its CPU reference. Write every intermediate quantity that leads to the stated result, including units or ownership where applicable.

**Self-check:** Retain the requested calculation, output, diagram or explicit failure policy so another reader can compare it with the worked cases.

**Hint 1:** Start with the literal input and intermediate quantities in worked example 1.

**Hint 2:** Review the mechanism paragraph and the relevant bounded CPU assertion; separate mathematical reasoning from optional device evidence.

### Exercise 2

Reconstruct the second worked example without copying its conclusion. Identify the changed input or condition, show the resulting calculation or dependency, and explain why it differs from the first example.

**Self-check:** Retain the requested calculation, output, diagram or explicit failure policy so another reader can compare it with the worked cases.

**Hint 1:** Identify exactly which condition changes in worked example 2.

**Hint 2:** Review the mechanism paragraph and the relevant bounded CPU assertion; separate mathematical reasoning from optional device evidence.

### Exercise 3

Estimate useful bytes for adding two length-1,000 float64 vectors.

**Self-check:** Retain the requested calculation, output, diagram or explicit failure policy so another reader can compare it with the worked cases.

**Hint 1:** Use the first worked example to establish the relevant quantities, then change only the requested input.

**Hint 2:** Review the mechanism paragraph and the relevant bounded CPU assertion; separate mathematical reasoning from optional device evidence.

### Exercise 4

A calculation divides bytes by TFLOP/s and calls the result seconds. Diagnose it.

**Self-check:** Retain the requested calculation, output, diagram or explicit failure policy so another reader can compare it with the worked cases.

**Hint 1:** Locate the failed phase or violated dependency before proposing a repair.

**Hint 2:** Review the mechanism paragraph and the relevant bounded CPU assertion; separate mathematical reasoning from optional device evidence.

### Exercise 5

Why is a roofline less useful for a one-element kernel?

**Self-check:** Retain the requested calculation, output, diagram or explicit failure policy so another reader can compare it with the worked cases.

**Hint 1:** Check what the algorithm is allowed to read, write or assume at this boundary.

**Hint 2:** Review the mechanism paragraph and the relevant bounded CPU assertion; separate mathematical reasoning from optional device evidence.

### Exercise 6

A tiled kernel reduces global reads but doubles register use. What evidence decides?

**Self-check:** Retain the requested calculation, output, diagram or explicit failure policy so another reader can compare it with the worked cases.

**Hint 1:** State the output contract and which observations are needed in the new application.

**Hint 2:** Review the mechanism paragraph and the relevant bounded CPU assertion; separate mathematical reasoning from optional device evidence.

## Common mistakes and diagnosis

A tempting but incorrect claim in this chapter is: **peak TFLOPS predicts every kernel, or a kernel speedup is automatically an application speedup.**

For the concrete failure exercise, a calculation divides bytes by TFLOP/s and calls the result seconds. Diagnose it.
Preserve the original input and the stage where behavior diverged. Compare with
the CPU model or dependency diagram before changing hardware configuration.
A compiler result, synthetic timing model, profiler counter and returned numeric
answer support different claims. Record unavailable hardware honestly.

## Self-check, retrieval and transfer

Explain the first example without its code, then use the second example to state
one assumption that matters. Complete Exercise 3 independently, use Exercise 4 to
diagnose a plausible defect, check the boundary in Exercise 5, and retain the
application contract from Exercise 6. Compare the [separate explanations](../solutions/cuda-007_solutions.md)
only after your attempt or a deliberate reveal. A reading marker records your
choice; it does not certify hardware qualification or expert mastery.
