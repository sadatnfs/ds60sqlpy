-- Day 46: Project 1 - E-commerce Analytics (Part 1)
-- BEGINNER WORKFLOW — sql-46: Project1 Ecommerce Part1
-- Guide: sql/postgres-60day/companion-guides/day46_project1_ecommerce_part1.md
-- Recommended runner: open the private lesson reader and choose
-- "Create/open guided SQL notebook". It verifies advanced_sql_training,
-- creates an ignored .learning/sql/sql-46/ copy, and prints the full
-- psql transcript below the run cell. Edit that private copy, not this official
-- source, while studying.
-- Read every SELECT as FROM/JOIN -> WHERE -> GROUP BY/aggregate -> HAVING ->
-- window calculation -> SELECT -> ORDER BY -> LIMIT. Before each statement,
-- declare what one input row and one output row represent. A displayed result
-- set is temporary; NULL, zero, an empty string, and an absent row differ.
-- Primary objects in the worked examples: orders, order_items, customers.
-- Success means the first error never appears, psql exits 0, result keys and
-- control totals match the stated contract, and verification passes. The lesson's documented transaction/cleanup boundary restores disposable state.
-- Keep all numbered exercises answer-free here: write predictions and attempts
-- only in your ignored working copy.

-- Exercises
-- 1. Create LTV segments (gold/silver/bronze) based on thresholds and analyze by country.
--    Inputs: Use only the declared lesson objects (orders, order_items, customers) and any small disposable fixture the prompt explicitly asks you to create.
--    Expected result/shape: Expect a successful command tag plus a catalog/behavior result that shows the named object or invariant; do not count an unverified CREATE/ALTER as completion.
--    Verify: Query pg_catalog/information_schema where appropriate, then run one valid and one boundary case inside the lesson safety boundary.
--    Hint ladder, rung 1: Write the row grain and invariant in prose first; then map each requirement to the smallest column, key, constraint, or migration step.
-- 2. Compute revenue per cohort month at month offsets 0..12.
--    Inputs: Use only the declared lesson objects (orders, order_items, customers) and any small disposable fixture the prompt explicitly asks you to create.
--    Expected result/shape: Return the keys/measures named by the prompt at one explicitly declared row grain, with deterministic order for ranked or limited output and an explicit policy for NULL/empty input.
--    Verify: Check uniqueness at the declared grain and compare row counts or totals with a simpler control query over the same population.
--    Hint ladder, rung 1: Build FROM/JOIN and inspect keys first; add filtering, grouping/windows, projection, and deterministic ordering one stage at a time.
-- 3. Prediction: compare NTILE(4) with fixed monetary thresholds. Explain why a
--    customer's label can change under NTILE when unrelated customers arrive.
--    Inputs: Use only the declared lesson objects (orders, order_items, customers) and any small disposable fixture the prompt explicitly asks you to create.
--    Expected result/shape: Record the prediction first, then capture both result/plan shapes with the prompt's named keys, measures, row counts, or SQLSTATE.
--    Verify: Use identical inputs for the comparison and explain every observed difference; revise the prediction when the transcript disagrees.
--    Hint ladder, rung 1: Hold every input constant, change one clause or case, and write down the expected row count/shape before executing either form.
-- 4. Construction: calculate customer LTV, order count, average order value, and
--    days since last order in one customer-grain result.
--    Inputs: Use only the declared lesson objects (orders, order_items, customers) and any small disposable fixture the prompt explicitly asks you to create.
--    Expected result/shape: Return the keys/measures named by the prompt at one explicitly declared row grain, with deterministic order for ranked or limited output and an explicit policy for NULL/empty input.
--    Verify: Check uniqueness at the declared grain and compare row counts or totals with a simpler control query over the same population.
--    Hint ladder, rung 1: Build FROM/JOIN and inspect keys first; add filtering, grouping/windows, projection, and deterministic ordering one stage at a time.
-- 5. Debugging: repair an LTV query that joins payments and order_items at raw
--    grain and therefore multiplies revenue.
--    Inputs: Use only the declared lesson objects (orders, order_items, customers) and any small disposable fixture the prompt explicitly asks you to create.
--    Expected result/shape: Show the incorrect/failing behavior and then a corrected result with the violated invariant, keys, and row grain visible.
--    Verify: Keep a minimal failing case and reconcile corrected counts/totals against an independent control rather than checking syntax alone.
--    Hint ladder, rung 1: Reproduce the smallest wrong result first, then inspect the earliest relation or clause where its grain/count stops matching the contract.
-- 6. Edge case: retain customers with no orders, assign zero LTV, and explain
--    where COALESCE belongs so the LEFT JOIN remains outer.
--    Inputs: Use only the declared lesson objects (orders, order_items, customers) and any small disposable fixture the prompt explicitly asks you to create.
--    Expected result/shape: Record the prediction first, then capture both result/plan shapes with the prompt's named keys, measures, row counts, or SQLSTATE.
--    Verify: Use identical inputs for the comparison and explain every observed difference; revise the prediction when the transcript disagrees.
--    Hint ladder, rung 1: Hold every input constant, change one clause or case, and write down the expected row count/shape before executing either form.
